Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and LHC energies - A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.

Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions - We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and Westermann and Hendrickson.

The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field fluid model - The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

A determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single-source automata - We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the determinant.

From dyadic $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ to $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ - In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge 0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.

Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance - We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.

Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit - A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple cosmological model.

Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material properties - A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.

The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds. IX. The Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS - We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set.

Partial cubes: structures, characterizations, and constructions - Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given. The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.

Computing genus 2 Hilbert-Siegel modular forms over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence - In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field $\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.

Distribution of integral Fourier Coefficients of a Modular Form of Half Integral Weight Modulo Primes - Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of half integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's conjecture for overpartitions.

$p$-adic Limit of Weakly Holomorphic Modular Forms of Half Integral Weight - Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.

Iterated integral and the loop product - In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology and differential forms based on the theory of Chen's iterated integrals and the cyclic bar complex.

Fermionic superstring loop amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism - The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond states.

Lifetime of doubly charmed baryons - In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculate the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the simple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate experiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must be some unknown mechanism to be explored.

Spectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in Quiescence - Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600 km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model.

In quest of a generalized Callias index theorem - We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as regulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all odd dimensions. We show that the problem of computing the dimension of the moduli space of self-dual strings can be formulated as an index problem in even-dimensional (loop-)space. We think that the regulator used in this Letter can be applied to this index problem.

Approximation for extinction probability of the contact process based on the Gr\"obner basis - In this note we give a new method for getting a series of approximations for the extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process by using the Gr\"obner basis.

Measurement of the Hadronic Form Factor in D0 --> K- e+ nue Decays - The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue has been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical calculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction, relative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0 --> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these results, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the normalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and from external inputs, respectively.

Molecular Synchronization Waves in Arrays of Allosterically Regulated Enzymes - Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysis based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered system.

Stochastic Lie group integrators - We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.

ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere - The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics, remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research. Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8 mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

Formation of quasi-solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film media - The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges. In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.

Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons in Strongly Correlated Systems by Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo Method - We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states of the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the approximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times and perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model.

Placeholder Substructures II: Meta-Fractals, Made of Box-Kites, Fill Infinite-Dimensional Skies - Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or "Sky" when it is interpreted as the "strut constant" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called "Box-Kites" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or "recipes" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.

Filling-Factor-Dependent Magnetophonon Resonance in Graphene - We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon at the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Raman spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and (-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice modes.

Pfaffians, hafnians and products of real linear functionals - We prove pfaffian and hafnian versions of Lieb's inequalities on determinants and permanents of positive semi-definite matrices. We use the hafnian inequality to improve the lower bound of R\'ev\'esz and Sarantopoulos on the norm of a product of linear functionals on a real Euclidean space (this subject is sometimes called the `real linear polarization constant' problem).

Understanding the Flavor Symmetry Breaking and Nucleon Flavor-Spin Structure within Chiral Quark Model - In $\XQM$, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon flavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of constituent quarks implied in $\XQM$ caused by the Goldstone boson emission process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from $\XQM$, the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon flavor-spin structure.

Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions - We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement

Crystal channeling of LHC forward protons with preserved distribution in phase space - We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC.

Probing non-standard neutrino interactions with supernova neutrinos - We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future galactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. I. Theoretical analysis - We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers. Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.

Origin of adaptive mutants: a quantum measurement? - This is a supplement to the paper arXiv:q-bio/0701050, containing the text of correspondence sent to Nature in 1990.

Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. II. An extrapolation technique to increase the accuracy - We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.

A remark on the number of steady states in a multiple futile cycle - The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1 steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one steady state.

The discrete dipole approximation for simulation of light scattering by particles much larger than the wavelength - In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and 2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory. Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.

The discrete dipole approximation: an overview and recent developments - We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a general method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects, the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.

Scalar radius of the pion and zeros in the form factor - The quadratic pion scalar radius, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s, plays an important role for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain, using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es equations, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.61\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method and show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from QCD.

Multilinear function series in conditionally free probability with amalgamation - As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced by positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of multilinear function series.

Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry - We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group) in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.

General System theory, Like-Quantum Semantics and Fuzzy Sets - It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum coherence.

Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods - We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i) based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy "trimming") and (ii) based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples: 1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid. All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic quasiequilibria.

Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in magnetized weakly collisional plasmas - We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks). The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the "inertial range" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the "dissipation range" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical applications are discussed in detail.

Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows over a gradual slope with bottom friction - This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media.

A limit relation for entropy and channel capacity per unit cost - In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to generalization of the conjecture.

Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources: Part I - The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources. The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

Inference on white dwarf binary systems using the first round Mock LISA Data Challenges data sets - We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the first round of the Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC) for white dwarf binaries. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.

An algorithm for the classification of smooth Fano polytopes - We present an algorithm that produces the classification list of smooth Fano d-polytopes for any given d. The input of the algorithm is a single number, namely the positive integer d. The algorithm has been used to classify smooth Fano d-polytopes for d<=7. There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 6-polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 7-polytopes.

Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources: Part II - Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission sources. Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission analysis.

Visualizing Teleportation - A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described, allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon. The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining teleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical description, out of which teleportation arises naturally.

Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries - We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose Lorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.

A Global Approach to the Theory of Special Finsler Manifolds - The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald, Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible, semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent, $C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like, $R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special Finsler spaces considered.

The Hardy-Lorentz Spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$ - In this paper we consider the Hardy-Lorentz spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$, with $0<p\le 1$, $0<q\le \infty$. We discuss the atomic decomposition of the elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior of singular integrals and other operators acting on them.

Potassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional study - Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.

Phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics - We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. After identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a careful zero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, we determine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with the help of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of this model are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar phase for intermediate temperatures.

High-spin to low-spin and orbital polarization transitions in multiorbital Mott systems - We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state.

Intelligent Life in Cosmology - I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.

The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in the Single-Lined Eclipsing Binary HAT-TR-205-013 - We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU. Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04 \pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.

Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei at intermediate energies - We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed.

Intersection Bodies and Generalized Cosine Transforms - Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call $\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some known facts and give them new proofs.

On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks - In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$, without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both simulated and real DNA sequences.

Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay - Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.

Nilpotent symmetry invariance in the superfield formulation: the (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories - We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular, we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism. Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry invariance.

Littlewood-Richardson polynomials - We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A. Okounkov and G. Olshanski.

Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation relations for free fields - Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data.

Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis - Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers, photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

A Note About the {Ki(z)} Functions - In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful properties of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions which generalize Kurepa's [Kurepa 1971] left factorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of these results and we answer the open question stated in [Petojevic 2006]. Finally, we discuss the differential transcendency of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions.

Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps - The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient "marching orders" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting.

Coincidence of the oscillations in the dipole transition and in the persistent current of narrow quantum rings with two electrons - The fractional Aharonov-Bohm oscillation (FABO) of narrow quantum rings with two electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, the evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have been found.

Pairwise comparisons of typological profiles (of languages) - No abstract given; compares pairs of languages from World Atlas of Language Structures.

The decomposition method and Maple procedure for finding first integrals of nonlinear PDEs of any order with any number of independent variables - In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders. It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s), each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE. Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its highest derivatives. The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.

A transcendental approach to Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem - We treat Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differential geometric) viewpoint. More precisely, we give a curvature condition which implies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem is formulated for a compact K\"ahler manifold, but the proof uses the space of harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K\"ahler metric. We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral sequence.

Injective Morita contexts (revisited) - This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita $\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum. We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and injective right wide Morita contexts.

Strong decays of charmed baryons - There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons in the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S-wave, P-wave, D-wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the $^3P_0$ model. After comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data, we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed baryons observed recently.

CP violation in beauty decays - Precision tests of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model of CP violation are discussed, pointing out possible signatures for other sources of CP violation and for new flavor-changing operators. The current status of the most accurate tests is summarized.

Universal Forces and the Dark Energy Problem - The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and our understanding of relativity and space-time. Here a novel idea of Fundamental Forces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition to providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.

Linear perturbations of matched spacetimes: the gauge problem and background symmetries - We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of matched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introduced in the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisit the particular case of spherically symmetry in n-dimensions. This analysis includes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell cosmologies.

Operator algebras associated with unitary commutation relations - We define nonselfadjoint operator algebras with generators $L_{e_1},..., L_{e_n}, L_{f_1},...,L_{f_m}$ subject to the unitary commutation relations of the form \[ L_{e_i}L_{f_j} = \sum_{k,l} u_{i,j,k,l} L_{f_l}L_{e_k}\] where $u= (u_{i,j,k,l})$ is an $nm \times nm$ unitary matrix. These algebras, which generalise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a single vertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix $u$.

Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical Evaporation - We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values (although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the globular cluster system.

Quantum Deformations of Relativistic Symmetries - We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. In the case of Poincare algebra it is shown that almost all classical r-matrices of S. Zakrzewski classification correspond to twisted deformations of Abelian and Jordanian types. A part of twists corresponding to the r-matrices of Zakrzewski classification are given in explicit form.

Matter-Wave Bright Solitons with a Finite Background in Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates - We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.

Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)? - The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested density matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble in quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one) distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the {\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and, simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.

Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions - We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim (t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an "ordinary" shock, at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally, independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

A Universality in PP-Waves - We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas - We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles.

Approximate solutions to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between hyperbolic spaces - Our main result in this paper is the following: Given $H^m, H^n$ hyperbolic spaces of dimensional $m$ and $n$ corresponding, and given a Holder function $f=(s^1,...,f^{n-1}):\partial H^m\to \partial H^n$ between geometric boundaries of $H^m$ and $H^n$. Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map $u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of Euclidean) and $u|_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$.

Some new experimental photonic flame effect features - The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics of radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented. Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long- term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of the liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the same as in opal matrixes.

A general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws: nonparametric regression - Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.

Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) - Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) has three recursive sampling/optimization shells. An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) optimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multiple Projects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probability distributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probability distributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options on schedules.. Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) are applied to develop a relative risk analysis among projects.

Groups with finitely many conjugacy classes and their automorphisms - We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of small cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely generated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate elements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into such groups. As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countable group $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$, where $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) and containing exactly two conjugacy classes.

Energy density for chiral lattice fermions with chemical potential - We study a recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finite density. In particular we compute the energy density as a function of the chemical potential and the temperature. It is shown that overlap fermions with chemical potential reproduce the correct continuum behavior.

Aspects of Electron-Phonon Self-Energy Revealed from Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy - Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions. Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects, the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these arguments are not well founded.

Timing and Lensing of the Colliding Bullet Clusters: barely enough time and gravity to accelerate the bullet - We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data. {\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the "bullet" X-ray gas can move with V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x 10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of $4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter $M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le 1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.

Geometry of Locally Compact Groups of Polynomial Growth and Shape of Large Balls - We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series of nilpotent groups.

Much ado about 248 - In this note we present three representations of a 248-dimensional Lie algebra, namely the algebra of Lie point symmetries admitted by a system of five trivial ordinary differential equations each of order forty-four, that admitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each of order twenty-eight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differential equation of order two hundred and forty-four.

Conformal Field Theory and Operator Algebras - We review recent progress in operator algebraic approach to conformal quantum field theory. Our emphasis is on use of representation theory in classification theory. This is based on a series of joint works with R. Longo.

Sparsely-spread CDMA - a statistical mechanics based analysis - Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively small number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of statistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a comparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.

On Ando's inequalities for convex and concave functions - For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved the inequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \le ||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama, and Kosem, respectively. In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $||| f(A)-f(B) ||| \le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \ge ||| g(|A-B|) |||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively in the special case when $A\ge ||B||$. In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated majorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself a Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows to strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.

Topology Change of Black Holes - The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii) Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space-times.

The birth of string theory - In this contribution we go through the developments that in the years 1968 to 1974 led from the Veneziano model to the bosonic string.

Duality and Tameness - We prove a duality theorem for certain graded algebras and show by various examples different kinds of failure of tameness of local cohomology.

Generalized regularly discontinuous solutions of the Einstein equations - The physical consistency of the match of piecewise-$C^0$ metrics is discussed. The mathematical theory of gravitational discontinuity hypersurfaces is generalized to cover the match of regularly discontinuous metrics. The mean-value differential geometry framework on a hypersurface is introduced, and corresponding compatibility conditions are deduced. Examples of generalized boundary layers, gravitational shock waves and thin shells are studied.

A geometric realization of sl(6,C) - Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra L of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an explicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L. This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a natural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study of a rich and interesting algebraic structure.

Rigid subsets of symplectic manifolds - We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.

Multiple Parton Scattering in Nuclei: Quark-quark Scattering - Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied systematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark (antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark) distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.

Experimental modeling of physical laws - A physical law is represented by the probability distribution of a measured variable. The probability density is described by measured data using an estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. The experimental information and data redundancy are defined in terms of information entropy. The model cost function, comprised of data redundancy and estimation error, is minimized by the creation-annihilation process.

Reducing SAT to 2-SAT - Description of a polynomial time reduction of SAT to 2-SAT of polynomial size.

Half-metallic silicon nanowires - From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM) atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on spintronic applications of silicon nanowires.

On Equivariant Embedding of Hilbert C^* modules - We prove that an arbitrary (not necessarily countably generated) Hilbert $G$-$\cla$ module on a G-C^* algebra $\cla$ admits an equivariant embedding into a trivial $G-\cla$ module, provided G is a compact Lie group and its action on $\cla$ is ergodic.

Invariance and the twisted Chern character : a case study - We give details of the proof of the remark made in \cite{G2} that the Chern characters of the canonical generators on the K homology of the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ are not invariant under the natural $SU_q(2)$ coaction. Furthermore, the conjecture made in \cite{G2} about the nontriviality of the twisted Chern character coming from an odd equivariant spectral triple on $SU_q(2)$ is settled in the affirmative.

Placeholder Substructures III: A Bit-String-Driven ''Recipe Theory'' for Infinite-Dimensional Zero-Divisor Spaces - Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or "Sky" when it is interpreted as the "strut constant" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called "Box-Kites" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or "recipes" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.

Langmuir blodgett assembly of densely aligned single walled carbon nanotubes from bulk materials - Single walled carbon nanotubes exhibit advanced electrical and surface properties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to future manufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs into aligned forms. Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine SWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high current, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel SWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of aligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and packing of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by microfabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest regions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.

Quantum Phase Transition in the Four-Spin Exchange Antiferromagnet - We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).) This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously dimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the critical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle density. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense at the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach, which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the transition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the critical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding the order of the transition.

Smooth maps with singularities of bounded K-codimensions - We will prove the relative homotopy principle for smooth maps with singularities of a given {\cal K}-invariant class with a mild condition. We next study a filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a given manifold P by considering singularities of non-negative {\cal K}-codimensions.

Stringy Jacobi fields in Morse theory - We consider the variation of the surface spanned by closed strings in a spacetime manifold. Using the Nambu-Goto string action, we induce the geodesic surface equation, the geodesic surface deviation equation which yields a Jacobi field, and we define the index form of a geodesic surface as in the case of point particles to discuss conjugate strings on the geodesic surface.

Lower ground state due to counter-rotating wave interaction in trapped ion system - We consider a single ion confined in a trap under radiation of two traveling waves of lasers. In the strong-excitation regime and without the restriction of Lamb-Dicke limit, the Hamiltonian of the system is similar to a driving Jaynes-Cummings model without rotating wave approximation (RWA). The approach we developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes it available to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the ground state in our non-RWA solution is energically lower than the counterpart under the RWA. If we have the ion in the ground state, it is equivalent to a spin dependent force on the trapped ion. Discussion is made for the difference between the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevant experimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantum information processing.

Strained single-crystal Al2O3 grown layer-by-layer on Nb (110) thin films - We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.

Quasi-quartet crystal electric field ground state in a tetragonal CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystal - We have successfully grown the single crystals of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$, for the first time, by flux method and studied the anisotropic physical properties by measuring the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. We found that CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}$ = 4.6 K. The electrical resistivity and susceptibility data reveal strong anisotropic magnetic properties. The magnetization measured at $T$ = 2 K exhibited two metamagnetic transitions at $H_{\rm m1}$ = 31 kOe and $H_{\rm m2}$ = 44.7 kOe, for $H \parallel$ [100] with a saturation magnetization of 1.6 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce. The crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the inverse susceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited states of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ are closely spaced indicating a quasi-quartet ground state. The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced energy levels.

Strong Phase and $D^0-D^0bar$ mixing at BES-III - Most recently, both BaBar and Belle experiments found evidences of neutral $D$ mixing. In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phase difference in $D^0 \to K\pi$ decay from the measurements of the mixing parameters, $y^\prime$, $y_{CP}$ and $x$ at the $B$ factories. The sensitivity of the measurement of the mixing parameter $y$ is estimated in BES-III experiment at $\psi(3770)$ peak. We also make an estimate on the measurements of the mixing rate $R_M$. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phase difference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the $D\bar{D}$ threshold with CP tag technique at BES-III experiment.

Meta-Stable Brane Configuration of Product Gauge Groups - Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and obtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold 6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c') gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.

Spinor dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates; Classical spin approach - Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction dominated Bose-Einstein condensates are discussed under spinful situations. We treat the spin degrees of freedom as a classical spin vector, approaching from large spin limit to obtain an effective minimal Hamiltonian; a version extended from a non-linear sigma model. By solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures where the mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trap geometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipole interaction.

Nonlinear Dynamics of the Phonon Stimulated Emission in Microwave Solid-State Resonator of the Nonautonomous Phaser Generator - The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally and numerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantum generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050) Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.

Proper J-holomorphic discs in Stein domains of dimension 2 - We prove the existence of global Bishop discs in a strictly pseudoconvex Stein domain in an almost complex manifold of complex dimension 2.

Anisotropic thermo-elasticity in 2D -- Part I: A unified approach - In this note we develop tools and techniques for the treatment of anisotropic thermo-elasticity in two space dimensions. We use a diagonalisation technique to obtain properties of the characteristic roots of the full symbol of the system in order to prove $L^p$--$L^q$ decay rates for its solutions.

I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films - The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have been studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles. Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

Magnetic Fingerprints of sub-100 nm Fe Nanodots - Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but also exhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions are comparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic "fingerprints" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to vortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal striking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis loops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a calculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm nanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the vortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation and annihilation fields.

An online repository of Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs - Context. Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate accurate light curves rapidly. Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as necessary for a fading source. Results. The light curve repository website (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.

On the total disconnectedness of the quotient Aubry set - In this paper we show that the quotient Aubry set associated to certain Lagrangians is totally disconnected (i.e., every connected component consists of a single point). Moreover, we discuss the relation between this problem and a Morse-Sard type property for (difference of) critical subsolutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

New simple modular Lie superalgebras as generalized prolongs - Over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>2, prolongations of the simple finite dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix are studied for certain simplest gradings of these algebras. Several new simple Lie superalgebras are discovered, serial and exceptional, including superBrown and superMelikyan superalgebras. Simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix of rank 2 are classified.

Vacuum Structure and Potential - Based on overall experimental observations, especially the pair processes, I developed a model structure of the vacuum along with a basic-particle formation scheme begun in 2000 (with collaborator P-I Johansson). The model consists in that the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons, consisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ of zero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with a Coulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005) and referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers. I outline in this easier accessible paper the detailed derivation of the model and a corresponding quantitative determination of the vacuuon size.

Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts - We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.

PAH emission and star formation in the host of the z~2.56 Cloverleaf QSO - We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an intense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time ~3E7yr) star forming event.

Causal dissipative hydrodynamics for QGP fluid in 2+1 dimensions - In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics. For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.

A Single Trapped Ion as a Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator - We show how a single trapped ion may be used to test a variety of important physical models realized as time-dependent harmonic oscillators. The ion itself functions as its own motional detector through laser-induced electronic transitions. Alsing et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220401 (2005)] proposed that an exponentially decaying trap frequency could be used to simulate (thermal) Gibbons-Hawking radiation in an expanding universe, but the Hamiltonian used was incorrect. We apply our general solution to this experimental proposal, correcting the result for a single ion and showing that while the actual spectrum is different from the Gibbons-Hawking case, it nevertheless shares an important experimental signature with this result.

Compounding Fields and Their Quantum Equations in the Trigintaduonion Space - The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.

Topological defects, geometric phases, and the angular momentum of light - Recent reports on the intriguing features of vector vortex bearing beams are analyzed using geometric phases in optics. It is argued that the spin redirection phase induced circular birefringence is the origin of topological phase singularities arising in the inhomogeneous polarization patterns. A unified picture of recent results is presented based on this proposition. Angular momentum shift within the light beam (OAM) has exact equivalence with the angular momentum holonomy associated with the geometric phase consistent with our conjecture.

Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr spacetimes - We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the "normal" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named "nearly horizon-skimming orbits". Our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

The Blue Straggler Population of the Globular Cluster M5 - By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based observations, in ultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS) population of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central regions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the cluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a bimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular clusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations suggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar collisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer processes in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial distribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal radius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an "evaporating" BSS.

Entanglement entropy of two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter black holes - Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.

Towards self-consistent definition of instanton liquid parameters - The possibility of self-consistent determination of instanton liquid parameters is discussed together with the definition of optimal pseudo-particle configurations and comparing the various pseudo-particle ensembles. The weakening of repulsive interactions between pseudo-particles is argued and estimated.

Some aspects of the nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model - A nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model is considered. First we integrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q. Then we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformation of the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k < Lambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation is consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration results for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the phi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare the expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic perturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which sense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.

Instanton Liquid at Finite Temperature and Chemical Potential of Quarks - Instanton liquid in heated and strongly interacting matter is studied using the variational principle. The dependence of the instanton liquid density (gluon condensate) on the temperature and the quark chemical potential is determined under the assumption that, at finite temperatures, the dominant contribution is given by an ensemble of calorons. The respective one-loop effective quark Lagrangian is used.

Eternal inflation and localization on the landscape - We model the essential features of eternal inflation on the landscape of a dense discretuum of vacua by the potential $V(\phi)=V_{0}+\delta V(\phi)$, where $|\delta V(\phi)|\ll V_{0}$ is random. We find that the diffusion of the distribution function $\rho(\phi,t)$ of the inflaton expectation value in different Hubble patches may be suppressed due to the effect analogous to the Anderson localization in disordered quantum systems. At $t \to \infty$ only the localized part of the distribution function $\rho (\phi, t)$ survives which leads to dynamical selection principle on the landscape. The probability to measure any but a small value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble patch on the landscape is exponentially suppressed at $t\to \infty$.

Singularity Resolution in Isotropic Loop Quantum Cosmology: Recent Developments - Since the past Iagrg meeting in December 2004, new developments in loop quantum cosmology have taken place, especially with regards to the resolution of the Big Bang singularity in the isotropic models. The singularity resolution issue has been discussed in terms of physical quantities (expectation values of Dirac observables) and there is also an ``improved'' quantization of the Hamiltonian constraint. These developments are briefly discussed. This is an expanded version of the review talk given at the 24$^{\mathrm{th}}$ IAGRG meeting in February 2007.

Vortices in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory - Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids. In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear optics, and type-II superconductors.

A POVM view of the ensemble approach to polarization optics - Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4, 433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne (Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way of realizing different types of Mueller devices.

Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from equation-of-motion approach - The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in semiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach for different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various mechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine interaction are included. The relative contributions from these spin decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature, though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.

Construction of initial data for 3+1 numerical relativity - This lecture is devoted to the problem of computing initial data for the Cauchy problem of 3+1 general relativity. The main task is to solve the constraint equations. The conformal technique, introduced by Lichnerowicz and enhanced by York, is presented. Two standard methods, the conformal transverse-traceless one and the conformal thin sandwich, are discussed and illustrated by some simple examples. Finally a short review regarding initial data for binary systems (black holes and neutron stars) is given.

Magnetism and Thermodynamics of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Diamond Chains in a Magnetic Field - The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond chains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0 (frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0 (non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and $4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition, the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with our TMRG results.

Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data - The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x) the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy. With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly related variables.

Kinetic equation for finite systems of fermions with pairing - The solutions of the Wigner-transformed time-dependent Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov equations are studied in the constant-$\Delta$ approximation. This approximation is known to violate particle-number conservation. As a consequence, the density fluctuation and the longitudinal response function given by this approximation contain spurious contributions. A simple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-number conservation is proposed. Explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of the correlated systems and for the density response function are derived and it is shown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrum has an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. The collective response is studied for a simplified form of the residual interaction.

Reciprocal Symmetry and Classical Discrete Oscillator Incorporating Half-Integral Energy Levels - Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding (finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of half-integers.

Hadrons in Medium -- Theory confronts experiment - In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian; more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be part of any reliable theory.

A computer program for fast non-LTE analysis of interstellar line spectra - The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line observations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We present a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular lines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium calculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including radiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an escape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use of molecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance of the program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated methods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters from line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program should form an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio and infrared telescopes.

Nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field extrapolation scheme based on the direct boundary integral formulation - This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.

Alternative Approaches to the Equilibrium Properties of Hard-Sphere Liquids - An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed.

Complexities of Human Promoter Sequences - By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariance characteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent for the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at $\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths, respectively.

Evidence for an excitonic insulator phase in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ - We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$ in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and its low-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature the photoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of spectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral function for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features with very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic insulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$.

Oxygen-rich droplets and the enrichment of the ISM - We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario, the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed ORL-CEL discrepancy. (The full version of this work is submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics.)

Soft modes and NTE in Zn(CN)2 from Raman spectroscopy and first principles calculations - We have studied Zn(CN)2 at high pressure using Raman spectroscopy, and report Gruneisen parameters of the soft phonons. The phonon frequencies and eigen vectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of the observed phonon spectra. Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modes exhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft phonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit, with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapid disordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction.

Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics - Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.

Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data - Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale atomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially depends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like quasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co, icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.

On smooth foliations with Morse singularities - Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$ foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type result.

Frobenius-Schur indicators for semisimple Lie algebras - Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be a finite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mth Frobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m, the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For the classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the case for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively.

Supersymmetry breaking metastable vacua in runaway quiver gauge theories - In this paper we consider quiver gauge theories with fractional branes whose infrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). We show that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compact branes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closely related to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of the one-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct computation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the results for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to generalize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary values of the superpotential couplings.

Low Energy Aspects of Heavy Meson Decays - I discuss low energy aspects of heavy meson decays, where there is at least one heavy meson in the final state. Examples are $B -\bar{B}$ mixing, $B \to D \bar{D}$, $B \to D \eta'$, and $B \to D \gamma$. %and $B \to D W $ (Isgur-Wise function). The analysis is performed in the heavy quark limit within heavy-light chiral perturbation theory. Coefficients of $1/N_c$ suppressed chiral Lagrangian terms (beyond factorization) have been estimated by means of a heavy-light chiral quark model.

Radiative losses and cut-offs of energetic particles at relativistic shocks - We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses of electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are discussed.

Very strong and slowly varying magnetic fields as source of axions - The investigation on the production of particles in slowly varying but extremely intense magnetic field in extended to the case of axions. The motivation is, as for some previously considered cases, the possibility that such kind of magnetic field may exist around very compact astrophysical objects.

Symmetry disquisition on the TiOX phase diagram - The sequence of phase transitions and the symmetry of in particular the low temperature incommensurate and spin-Peierls phases of the quasi one-dimensional inorganic spin-Peierls system TiOX (TiOBr and TiOCl) have been studied using inelastic light scattering experiments. The anomalous first-order character of the transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the different symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$) phases. The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly suggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the formation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a comparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy scattering observed previously has a phononic origin.

Discovery of a point-like very-high-energy gamma-ray source in Monoceros - The complex Monoceros Loop SNR/Rosette Nebula region contains several potential sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission and two as yet unidentified high-energy EGRET sources. Sensitive VHE observations are required to probe acceleration processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope array has been used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this region. CO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the molecular clouds in the region, which could act as target material for gamma-ray production via hadronic interactions. We announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source, HESS J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This source is unresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart at other wavelengths but is possibly associated with the weak X-ray source 1RXS J063258.3+054857, the Be-star MWC 148 and/or the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521. No evidence for an associated molecular cloud was found in the CO data.

Thermal entanglement of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice - We show that temperature and magnetic field properties of the entanglement between spins on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice can be qualitatively described by analytical results for a qubit tetramer. Exact diagonalization of clusters with up to 20 sites reveals that the regime of fully entangled neighboring pairs coincides with the regime of finite spin gap in the spectrum. Additionally, the results for the regime of vanishing spin gap are discussed and related to the Heisenberg limit of the model.

Bonding of H in O vacancies of ZnO - We investigate the bonding of H in O vacancies of ZnO using density functional calculations. We find that H is anionic and does not form multicenter bonds with Zn in this compound.

Reparametrization Invariance, the controversial extraction of $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ and New Physics - The extraction of the weak phase $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays has been controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$. Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$ through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around $\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.

Solar System Constraints on Gauss-Bonnet Mediated Dark Energy - Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for general relativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifying gravity at solar system scales. We determine the solar system constraints due to this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional source. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential, and also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We constrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always finding extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We discuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological acceleration.

Switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular junctions - The electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of single photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with closed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory. The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.

Robust manipulation of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of singly charged quantum dots - Using the recently reported mode locking effect we demonstrate a highly robust control of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantum dots during the single spin coherence time. The spin precession in a transverse magnetic field can be fully controlled up to 25 K by the parameters of the exciting pulsed laser protocol such as the pulse train sequence, leading to adjustable quantum beat bursts in Faraday rotation. Flipping of the electron spin precession phase was demonstrated by inverting the polarization within a pulse doublet sequence.

Equation of state for dense hydrogen and plasma phase transition - We calculate the equation of state of dense hydrogen within the chemical picture. Fluid variational theory is generalized for a multi-component system of molecules, atoms, electrons, and protons. Chemical equilibrium is supposed for the reactions dissociation and ionization. We identify the region of thermodynamic instability which is related to the plasma phase transition. The reflectivity is calculated along the Hugoniot curve and compared with experimental results. The equation-of-state data is used to calculate the pressure and temperature profiles for the interior of Jupiter.

Experimental nonclassicality of single-photon-added thermal light states - We report the experimental realization and tomographic analysis of novel quantum light states obtained by exciting a classical thermal field by a single photon. Such states, although completely incoherent, possess a tunable degree of quantumness which is here exploited to put to a stringent experimental test some of the criteria proposed for the proof and the measurement of state non-classicality. The quantum character of the states is also given in quantum information terms by evaluating the amount of entanglement that they can produce.

Neutron Skin and Giant Resonances in Nuclei - Some aspects, both experimental and theoretical, of extracting the neutron skin $\Delta R$ from properties of isovector giant resonances are discussed. Existing proposals are critically reviewed. The method relying on the energy difference between the GTR and IAS is shown to lack sensitivity to $\Delta R$. A simple explanation of the linear relation between the symmetry energy and the neutron skin is also given.

Genetic Optimization of Photonic Bandgap Structures - We investigate the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a set of photonic crystals (PCs) in one and two dimensions. Our flexible design methodology allows us to optimize PC structures which are optimized for specific objectives. In this paper, we report the results of several such GA-based PC optimizations. We show that the GA performs well even in very complex design spaces, and therefore has great potential for use as a robust design tool in present and future applications.

Huge magneto-crystalline anisotropy of x-ray linear dichroism observed on Co/FeMn bilayers - We present an x-ray spectromicroscopic investigation of single-crystalline magnetic FeMn/Co bilayers on Cu(001), using X-ray magnetic circular (XMCD) and linear (XMLD) dichroism at the Co and Fe L3 absorption edges in combination with photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). Using the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we are able to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographic orientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time. We find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types of magnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystalline anisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the high sensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments at the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in a metallic system.

Temperature Dependence of the Tensile Properties of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes: O(N) Tight Binding MD Simulation - This paper examines the effect of temperature on the structural stability and mechanical properties of 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) under tensile loading using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) simulation method. We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its structural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in compression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing temperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit, Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10, 0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of 300K to 900K.

Gamma-ray emitting AGN and GLAST - I describe the different classes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the basic tenets of unified schemes. I then review the properties of the extragalactic sources detected in the GeV and TeV bands, showing that the vast majority of them belong to the very rare blazar class. I further discuss the kind of AGN GLAST is likely to detect, making some predictions going from the obvious to the likely, all the way to the less probable.

Potfit: effective potentials from ab-initio data - We present a program called potfit which generates an effective atomic interaction potential by matching it to a set of reference data computed in first-principles calculations. It thus allows to perform large-scale atomistic simulations of materials with physically justified potentials. We describe the fundamental principles behind the program, emphasizing its flexibility in adapting to different systems and potential models, while also discussing its limitations. The program has been used successfully in creating effective potentials for a number of complex intermetallic alloys, notably quasicrystals.

Dark energy and neutrino model in SUSY -- Remarks on active and sterile neutrinos mixing -- - We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory. The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable.

The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of sight towards HE 2347-4342 - We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342: QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302, $\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$ arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338. Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest. Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

Biased random walks on combs - We develop rigorous, analytic techniques to study the behaviour of biased random walks on combs. This enables us to calculate exactly the spectral dimension of random comb ensembles for any bias scenario in the teeth or spine. Two specific examples of random comb ensembles are discussed; the random comb with nonzero probability of an infinitely long tooth at each vertex on the spine and the random comb with a power law distribution of tooth lengths. We also analyze transport properties along the spine for these probability measures.

Monoid generalizations of the Richard Thompson groups - The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalized in a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids, called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to partial functions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have connections with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and D are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1 non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain infinite generating sets. Changes in this version: Section 4 has been thoroughly revised, and errors have been corrected; however, the main results of Section 4 do not change. Sections 1, 2, and 3 are unchanged, except for the proof of Theorem 2.3, which was incomplete; a complete proof was published in the Appendix of reference [6], and is also given here.

The Reliability on the Direction of the Incident Neutrino for the Fully Contained Events and Partially Contained Events due to QEL in the Super-Kamiokande - In the SK analysis of the neutrino events for [Fully Contained Events] and [Partially Contained Events] on their zenith angle distribution, it is assumed that the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of the detected charged lepton. In the present paper, we examine the validity of [the SK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking, we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of the SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate every physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation. From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.

Intricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution - A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a knotted structure in this protein.

Star Formation in Galaxies with Large Lower Surface Brightness Disks - We present B, R, and Halpha imaging data of 19 large disk galaxies whose properties are intermediate between classical low surface brightness galaxies and ordinary high surface brightness galaxies. We use data taken from the Lowell 1.8m Perkins telescope to determine the galaxies' overall morphology, color, and star formation properties. Morphologically, the galaxies range from Sb through Irr and include galaxies with and without nuclear bars. The colors of the galaxies vary from B-R = 0.3 - 1.9, and most show at least a slight bluing of the colors with increasing radius. The Halpha images of these galaxies show an average star formation rate lower than is found for similar samples with higher surface brightness disks. Additionally, the galaxies studied have both higher gas mass-to-luminosity and diffuse Halpha emission than is found in higher surface brightness samples.

Domain Wall Dynamics near a Quantum Critical Point - We study the real-time domain-wall dynamics near a quantum critical point of the one-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain. By numerical simulation, we find the domain wall is dynamically stable in the Heisenberg-Ising model. Near the quantum critical point, the width of the domain wall diverges as $(\Delta -1) ^{-1/2}$.

Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by fluctuating environment - We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model. The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling. Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

Group-theoretical properties of nilpotent modular categories - We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs).

Remarks on N_c dependence of decays of exotic baryons - We calculate the N_c dependence of the decay widths of exotic eikosiheptaplet within the framework of Chral Quark Soliton Model. We also discuss generalizations of regular baryon representations for arbitrary N_c.

Analysis of random Boolean networks using the average sensitivity - In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general model for genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was able to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random networks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

Theory of polariton mediated Raman scattering in microcavities - We calculate the intensity of the polariton mediated inelastic light scattering in semiconductor microcavities. We treat the exciton-photon coupling nonperturbatively and incorporate lifetime effects in both excitons and photons, and a coupling of the photons to the electron-hole continuum. Taking the matrix elements as fitting parameters, the results are in excellent agreement with measured Raman intensities due to optical phonons resonant with the upper polariton branches in II-VI microcavities with embedded CdTe quantum wells.

Decomposition numbers for finite Coxeter groups and generalised non-crossing partitions - Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and types $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter groups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of a Coxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a subgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation is "minimal" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s, $i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$ decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$ decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new. These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le \pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the "block structure" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras. Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which, in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.

Electromagnetic polarizabilities and the excited states of the nucleon - The electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon are shown to be essentially composed of the nonresonant $\alpha_p(E_{0+})=+3.2$, $\alpha_n(E_{0+})=+4.1$,the $t$-channel $\alpha^t_{p,n}=-\beta^t_{p,n}=+7.6$ and the resonant $\beta_{p,n}(P_{33}(1232))=+8.3$ contributions (in units of $10^{-4}$fm$^3$. The remaining deviations from the experimental data $\Delta\alpha_p=1.2\pm 0.6$, $\Delta\beta_p=1.2\mp 0.6$, \Delta\alpha_n=0.8\pm 1.7$ and $\Delta\beta_n=2.0\mp 1.8$ are contributed by a larger number of resonant and nonresonant processes with cancellations between the contributions. This result confirms that dominant contributions to the electric and magnetic polarizabilities may be represented in terms of two-photon couplings to the $\sigma$-meson having the predicted mass $m_\sigma=666$ MeV and two-photon width $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}=2.6$ keV.

Hecke-Clifford algebras and spin Hecke algebras I: the classical affine type - Associated to the classical Weyl groups, we introduce the notion of degenerate spin affine Hecke algebras and affine Hecke-Clifford algebras. For these algebras, we establish the PBW properties, formulate the intertwiners, and describe the centers. We further develop connections of these algebras with the usual degenerate (i.e. graded) affine Hecke algebras of Lusztig by introducing a notion of degenerate covering affine Hecke algebras.

Towards Minimal Resources of Measurement-based Quantum Computation - We improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement-based quantum computation. Minimizing the resources required for this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer based on projective measurements. This new upper bound allows also to reply in the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off between observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation.

A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula - We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42 class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold, starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

Non-Equilibrium Josephson and Andreev Current through Interacting Quantum Dots - We present a theory of transport through interacting quantum dots coupled to normal and superconducting leads in the limit of weak tunnel coupling. A Josephson current between two superconducting leads, carried by first-order tunnel processes, can be established by non-equilibrium proximity effect. Both Andreev and Josephson current is suppressed for bias voltages below a threshold set by the Coulomb charging energy. A $\pi$-transition of the supercurrent can be driven by tuning gate or bias voltages.

Discovery of X-ray emission from the young radio pulsar PSR J1357-6429 - We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429 (characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus blackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160 eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV luminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy channeled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed. The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and allow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a compact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from the source and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the X-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.

Resonant activation in bistable semiconductor lasers - We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.

Quark matter and the astrophysics of neutron stars - Some of the means through which the possible presence of nearly deconfined quarks in neutron stars can be detected by astrophysical observations of neutron stars from their birth to old age are highlighted.

Some non-braided fusion categories of rank 3 - We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with three simple object types. If a conjecture of Ostrik is true, our classification completes the classification of fusion categories with three simple object types. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete and useful variation of graphical calculus for fusion categories, discuss pivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementary re-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity.

Chandra Observations of Supernova 1987A - We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with {\it Chandra X-Ray Observatory} since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our {\it Chandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\it Chandra} data obtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of SN 1987A with {\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January), X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component plane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$ than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).

Classification of superpotentials - We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar curvature type" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\"ahler-Einstein product.

Linkedness and ordered cycles in digraphs - The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum outdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which encounters these vertices in this order.

Curvature and isocurvature perturbations in two-field inflation - We study cosmological perturbations in two-field inflation, allowing for non-standard kinetic terms. We calculate analytically the spectra of curvature and isocurvature modes at Hubble crossing, up to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We also compute numerically the evolution of the curvature and isocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end of inflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recently proposed model of `roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affect significantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end of inflation.

Geometric Complexity Theory V: On deciding nonvanishing of a generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficient - This article has been withdrawn because it has been merged with the earlier article GCT3 (arXiv: CS/0501076 [cs.CC]) in the series. The merged article is now available as: Geometric Complexity Theory III: on deciding nonvanishing of a Littlewood-Richardson Coefficient, Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics, vol. 36, issue 1, 2012, pp. 103-110.

A schematic model of scattering in PT-symmetric Quantum Mechanics - One-dimensional scattering problem admitting a complex, PT-symmetric short-range potential V(x) is considered. Using a Runge-Kutta-discretized version of Schroedinger equation we derive the formulae for the reflection and transmission coefficients and emphasize that the only innovation emerges in fact via a complexification of one of the potential-characterizing parameters.

The exact asymptotic of the collision time tail distribution for independent Brownian particles with different drifts - In this note we consider the time of the collision $\tau$ for $n$ independent Brownian motions $X^1_t,...,X_t^n$ with drifts $a_1,...,a_n$, each starting from $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$, where $x_1<...<x_n$. We show the exact asymptotics of $P_x(\tau>t) = C h(x)t^{-\alpha}e^{-\gamma t}(1 + o(1))$ as $t\to\infty$ and identify $C,h(x),\alpha,\gamma$ in terms of the drifts.

Ab initio Study of Graphene on SiC - Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphene layers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to the substrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrum observed experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing graphene appears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waals bonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interface is metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for single or double graphene coverage, respectively.

Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding Matrix - Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.

On Almost Periodicity Criteria for Morphic Sequences in Some Particular Cases - In some particular cases we give criteria for morphic sequences to be almost periodic (=uniformly recurrent). Namely, we deal with fixed points of non-erasing morphisms and with automatic sequences. In both cases a polynomial-time algorithm solving the problem is found. A result more or less supporting the conjecture of decidability of the general problem is given.

The Radio Emission, X-ray Emission, and Hydrodynamics of G328.4+0.2: A Comprehensive Analysis of a Luminous Pulsar Wind Nebula, its Neutron Star, and the Progenitor Supernova Explosion - We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermal radio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of this source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7 arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio Telescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs), low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.

Three Particle Correlations from STAR - Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape in central Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission, conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles. Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications of the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are discussed.

The Return of a Static Universe and the End of Cosmology - We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current $\Lambda$CDM universe forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so that observers in our "island universe" will be fundamentally incapable of determining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of the highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe was first presented.

Dark Matter annihilation in Draco: new considerations on the expected gamma flux - A new estimation of the gamma-ray flux that we expect to detect from SUSY dark matter annihilation from the Draco dSph is presented using the DM density profiles compatible with the latest observations. This calculation takes also into account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the telescope. We show that this effect is crucial in the way we will observe and interpret a possible signal detection. Finally, we discuss the prospects to detect a possible gamma signal from Draco for MAGIC and GLAST.

Magnetohydrodynamic Rebound Shocks of Supernovae - We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining `quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.

Are There Mach Cones in Heavy Ion Collisions? Three-Particle Correlations from STAR - We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a $3<p_T<4$ GeV/c trigger particle with two softer $1<p_T<2$ GeV/c particles. Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV$. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central Au+Au collisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition, the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simple QCD-\v{C}erenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_4$ are investigated in detail.

Exploring First Stars Era with GLAST - Cosmic infrared background (CIB) includes emissions from objects inaccessible to current telescopic studies, such as the putative Population III, the first stars. Recently, strong direct evidence for significant CIB levels produced by the first stars came from CIB fluctuations discovered in deep Spitzer images. Such CIB levels should have left a unique absorption feature in the spectra of high-z GRBs and blazars as suggested in [4]. This is observable with GLAST sources at z>2 and measuring this absorption will give important information on energetics and constituents of the first stars era.

Correlated modulation between the redshifted Fe K alpha line and the continuum emission in NGC 3783 - It has been suggested that X-ray observations of rapidly variable Seyfert galaxies may hold the key to probe the gas orbital motions in the innermost regions of accretion discs around black holes and, thus, trace flow patterns under the effect of the hole strong gravitational field. We explore this possibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. A detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest possible time-scales (few ks) using "excess maps" and cross-correlating light curves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K alpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature between 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks that is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source continuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe line and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion disc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the redshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line is likely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.

Isotopic Effects in Nuclear Reactions at Relativistic Energies - A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectile spectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratory with the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides a primary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at the FRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopic compositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similar for all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed in both neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtained from the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared with the limiting-temperature expectation.

Einstein vs Maxwell: Is gravitation a curvature of space, a field in flat space, or both? - Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, the gravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations in a straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\it acceleration tensor} = const. $\times$ {\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat space cosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy. In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between the Riemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case of a positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version of the Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior the components of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign, leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\Lambda$CDM model is covered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both the total energy and the zero point energy vanish.

Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry - This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs. NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt? - The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of 0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that, together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16 may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main Belt.

Interpolating and sampling sequences in finite Riemann surfaces - We provide a description of the interpolating and sampling sequences on a space of holomorphic functions with a uniform growth restriction defined on finite Riemann surfaces.

New algebraic aspects of perturbative and non-perturbative Quantum Field Theory - In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as periods of mixed (Tate) motives.

Many-body interband tunneling as a witness for complex dynamics in the Bose-Hubbard model - A perturbative model is studied for the tunneling of many-particle states from the ground band to the first excited energy band, mimicking Landau-Zener decay for ultracold, spinless atoms in quasi-one dimensional optical lattices subjected to a tunable tilting force. The distributions of the computed tunneling rates provide an independent and experimentally accessible signature of the regular-chaotic transition in the strongly correlated many-body dynamics of the ground band.

Comments on ``Are Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts consistent with the Ghirlanda relation?", by Campana et al.(astro--ph/0703676) - In their recent paper, Campana et al. (2007) found that 5 bursts, among those detected by Swift, are outliers with respect to the E_peak-E_gamma ("Ghirlanda") correlation. We instead argue that they are not.

The Determination of the Helicity of $W'$ Boson Couplings at the LHC - Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged gauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery channel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution, reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV and provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.

Curvature flows in semi-Riemannian manifolds - We prove that the limit hypersurfaces of converging curvature flows are stable, if the initial velocity has a weak sign, and give a survey of the existence and regularity results.

Hydrodynamic and Spectral Simulations of HMXB Winds - We describe preliminary results of a global model of the radiatively-driven photoionized wind and accretion flow of the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1. The full model combines FLASH hydrodynamic calculations, XSTAR photoionization calculations, HULLAC atomic data, and Monte Carlo radiation transport. We present maps of the density, temperature, velocity, and ionization parameter from a FLASH two-dimensional time-dependent simulation of Vela X-1, as well as maps of the emissivity distributions of the X-ray emission lines.

Radio Astrometric Detection and Characterization of Extra-Solar Planets: A White Paper Submitted to the NSF ExoPlanet Task Force - The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass planets possible. RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics. The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

Interface dynamics of microscopic cavities in water - An analytical description of the interface motion of a collapsing nanometer-sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation in conjunction with explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the two approaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent conditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be corrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and fluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correction accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover scales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in nonequilibrium.

Viscosity, Black Holes, and Quantum Field Theory - We review recent progress in applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to finite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamic behavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlation functions computed through a real-time AdS/CFT prescription, which we formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide a proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture. Possible implications for real systems are mentioned.

Superconducting states of the quasi-2D Holstein model: Effects of vertex and non-local corrections - I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations (non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.

Masers and star formation - Recent observational and theoretical advances concerning astronomical masers in star forming regions are reviewed. Major masing species are considered individually and in combination. Key results are summarized with emphasis on present science and future prospects.

Renormalized quasiparticles in antiferromagnetic states of the Hubbard model - We analyze the properties of the quasiparticle excitations of metallic antiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study is based on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent solutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical renormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these quasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf k$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle picture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total electron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.

Comparison of exact-exchange calculations for solids in current-spin-density- and spin-density-functional theory - The relative merits of current-spin-density- and spin-density-functional theory are investigated for solids treated within the exact-exchange-only approximation. Spin-orbit splittings and orbital magnetic moments are determined at zero external magnetic field. We find that for magnetic (Fe, Co and Ni) and non-magnetic (Si and Ge) solids, the exact-exchange current-spin-density functional approach does not significantly improve the accuracy of the corresponding spin-density functional results.

One-loop MHV Rules and Pure Yang-Mills - It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms. These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator, introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.

Fermi-liquid effects in the transresistivity in quantum Hall double layers near $\nu= 1/2 $ - Here, we present theoretical studies of the temperature and magnetic field dependences of the Coulomb drag transresistivity between two parallel layers of two dimensional electron gases in quantum Hall regime near half filling of the lowest Landau level. It is shown that Fermi-liquid interactions between the relevant quasiparticles could give a significant effect on the transresistivity, providing its independence of the interlayer spacing for spacings taking on values reported in the experiments. Obtained results agree with the experimental evidence.

Geometry of four-dimensional Killing spinors - The supersymmetric solutions of N=2, D=4 minimal ungauged and gauged supergravity are classified according to the fraction of preserved supersymmetry using spinorial geometry techniques. Subject to a reasonable assumption in the 1/2-supersymmetric time-like case of the gauged theory, we derive the complete form of all supersymmetric solutions. This includes a number of new 1/4- and 1/2-supersymmetric possibilities, like gravitational waves on bubbles of nothing in AdS_4.

A Rigorous Time-Domain Analysis of Full--Wave Electromagnetic Cloaking (Invisibility) - There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves. The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1} is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones, $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory. This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\"odinger form with the electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.

Non-perturbative conserving approximations and Luttinger's sum rule - Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series. Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation. Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are discussed.

2D-MIT as self-doping of a Wigner-Mott insulator - We consider an interaction-driven scenario for the two-dimensional metal-insulator transition in zero magnetic field (2D-MIT), based on melting the Wigner crystal through vacancy-interstitial pair formation. We show that the transition from the Wigner-Mott insulator to a heavy Fermi liquid emerges as an instability to self-doping, resembling conceptually the solid to normal liquid transition in He3. The resulting physical picture naturally explains many puzzling features of the 2D-MIT.

Entanglement of Subspaces and Error Correcting Codes - We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.

Does the present data on B_s - bar B_s mixing rule out a large enhancement in the branching ratio of B_s --> mu+ mu- ? - In this letter, we consider the constraints imposed by the recent measurement of B_s - bar B_s mixing on the new physics contribution to the rare decay B_s --> mu+ mu-. New physics in the form vector and axial-vector couplings is already severely constrained by the data on B --> (K,K*) mu+ mu-. Here, we show that B_s - bar B_s mixing data, together with the data on K0 - bar K0 mixing and K_L --> mu+ mu- decay rate, strongly constrain the scalar-pseudoscalar contribution to B_s --> mu+ mu-. We conclude that new physics can at best lead to a factor of 2 increase in the branching ratio of B_s --> mu+ mu- compared to its Standard Model expectation.

The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds VIII. Serpens Observed with MIPS - We present maps of 1.5 square degrees of the Serpens dark cloud at 24, 70, and 160\micron observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS Camera. More than 2400 compact sources have been extracted at 24um, nearly 100 at 70um, and 4 at 160um. We estimate completeness limits for our 24um survey from Monte Carlo tests with artificial sources inserted into the Spitzer maps. We compare source counts, colors, and magnitudes in the Serpens cloud to two reference data sets, a 0.50 deg^2 set on a low-extinction region near the dark cloud, and a 5.3 deg^2 subset of the SWIRE ELAIS N1 data that was processed through our pipeline. These results show that there is an easily identifiable population of young stellar object candidates in the Serpens Cloud that is not present in either of the reference data sets. We also show a comparison of visual extinction and cool dust emission illustrating a close correlation between the two, and find that the most embedded YSO candidates are located in the areas of highest visual extinction.

Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC - Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.

Modeling the three-point correlation function - We present new predictions for the galaxy three-point correlation function (3PCF) using high-resolution dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flat LCDM Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We create realistic mock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos and subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and color in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated 3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM halos and subhalos.

Multi-spectral Observations of Lunar Occultations: I. Resolving The Dust Shell Around AFGL 5440 - We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of the dust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over a continuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed spectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that the occultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY radiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the observed occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution described in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of the dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1. The observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the gradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic outflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a substantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher mass-loss rate in the past.

Orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions and the case of weighted projective spaces - These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other) quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.

Correlation functions in the Non Perturbative Renormalization Group and field expansion - The usual procedure of including a finite number of vertices in Non Perturbative Renormalization Group equations in order to obtain $n$-point correlation functions at finite momenta is analyzed. This is done by exploiting a general method recently introduced which includes simultaneously all vertices although approximating their momentum dependence. The study is performed using the self-energy of the tridimensional scalar model at criticality. At least in this example, low order truncations miss quantities as the critical exponent $\eta$ by as much as 60%. However, if one goes to high order truncations the procedure seems to converge rapidly.

Formation and Collisional Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects - This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the formation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution.

On Existence of Boundary Values of Polyharmonic Functions - In trigonometric series terms all polyharmonic functions inside the unit disk are described. For such functions it is proved the existence of their boundary values on the unit circle in the space of hyperfunctions. The necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the boundary value to belong to certain subspaces of the space of hyperfunctions.

Constraints on the Self-Interaction Cross-Section of Dark Matter from Numerical Simulations of the Merging Galaxy Cluster 1E 0657-5 - (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

Stringy Instantons at Orbifold Singularities - We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphic quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway directions.

Turbulent Diffusion of Lines and Circulations - We study material lines and passive vectors in a model of turbulent flow at infinite-Reynolds number, the Kraichnan-Kazantsev ensemble of velocities that are white-noise in time and rough (Hoelder continuous) in space. It is argued that the phenomenon of ``spontaneous stochasticity'' generalizes to material lines and that conservation of circulations generalizes to a ``martingale property'' of the stochastic process of lines.

Gluon Radiation of an Expanding Color Skyrmion in the Quark-Gluon Plasma - The density of states and energy spectrum of the gluon radiation are calculated for the color current of an expanding hydrodynamic skyrmion in the quark gluon plasma with a semiclassical method. Results are compared with those in literatures.

REM near-IR and optical multiband observations of PKS2155-304 in 2005 - Spectral variability is the main tool for constraining emission models of BL Lac objects. By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS 2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of months, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS 2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source. On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.

Supernova Polarization and the Type IIn Classification - While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness. We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination angle effects. The increasing number of known "hybrid" SNe with IIn-like emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us address the question of classification of "interacting SNe" and the possibility of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.

Near-Infrared Spectra of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary, A0620-00 - We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF. The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al. (1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH = 9.7+-0.6 M_solar.

Automated Generation of Layout and Control for Quantum Circuits - We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.

Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of 3C 66A during the WEBT campaign of 2003 -- 2004 - The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day time scales.

The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets. X. A m sin i = 11 Mearth planet around the nearby spotted M dwarf GJ 674 - Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars. Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5 dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days. Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level) magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary system.

An individual based model with global competition interaction: fluctuations effects in pattern formation - We present some numerical results obtained from a simple individual based model that describes clustering of organisms caused by competition. Our aim is to show how, even when a deterministic description developed for continuum models predicts no pattern formation, an individual based model displays well defined patterns, as a consequence of fluctuations effects caused by the discrete nature of the interacting agents.

A Comparison between Anomalous 6-cm H$_2$CO Absorption and CO(1-0) Emission in the L1204/S140 - We report observations of the dust cloud L1204 with the Onsala 25-m telescope in the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \htco. The observed region includes the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption against the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements. The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than the H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas located immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.

Dimers on surface graphs and spin structures. II - In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum field theory on surface graphs.

New version announcement for TaylUR, an arbitrary-order diagonal automatic differentiation package for Fortran 95 - We present a new version of TaylUR, a Fortran 95 module to automatically compute the numerical values of a complex-valued function's derivatives with respect to several variables up to an arbitrary order in each variable, but excluding mixed derivatives. The new version fixes a potentially serious bug in the code for exponential-related functions that could corrupt the imaginary parts of derivatives, as well as being compatible with a wider range of compilers.

Mapping radii of metric spaces - It is known that every closed curve of length \leq 4 in R^n (n>0) can be surrounded by a sphere of radius 1, and that this is the best bound. Letting S denote the circle of circumference 4, with the arc-length metric, we here express this fact by saying that the "mapping radius" of S in R^n is 1. Tools are developed for estimating the mapping radius of a metric space X in a metric space Y. In particular, it is shown that for X a bounded metric space, the supremum of the mapping radii of X in all convex subsets of normed metric spaces is equal to the infimum of the sup norms of all convex linear combinations of the functions d(x,-): X --> R (x\in X). Several explicit mapping radii are calculated, and open questions noted.

A New Model For The Loop-I (The North Polar Spur) Region - The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a large circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consisting of two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale structures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of the NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles. It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of the shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.

Leray numbers of projections and a topological Helly type theorem - Let X be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V. The rational Leray number L(X) of X is the minimal d such that the rational reduced homology of any induced subcomplex of X vanishes in dimensions d and above. Let \pi be a simplicial map from X to a simplex Y, such that the cardinality of the preimage of any point in |Y| is at most r. It is shown that L(\pi(X)) \leq r L(X)+r-1. One consequence is a topological extension of a Helly type result of Amenta.

q-Deformed spin foam models of quantum gravity - We numerically study Barrett-Crane models of Riemannian quantum gravity. We have extended the existing numerical techniques to handle q-deformed models and arbitrary space-time triangulations. We present and interpret expectation values of a few selected observables for each model, including a spin-spin correlation function which gives insight into the behaviour of the models. We find the surprising result that, as the deformation parameter q goes to 1 through roots of unity, the limit is discontinuous.

HI velocity dispersion in NGC 1058 - We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions.

Common Envelope Evolution Redux - Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

The Source of Turbulence in Astrophysical Disks: An Ill-posed Problem. - An critical overview of the current state of research in turbulence in astrophysical disks.

On Punctured Pragmatic Space-Time Codes in Block Fading Channel - This paper considers the use of punctured convolutional codes to obtain pragmatic space-time trellis codes over block-fading channel. We show that good performance can be achieved even when puncturation is adopted and that we can still employ the same Viterbi decoder of the convolutional mother code by using approximated metrics without increasing the complexity of the decoding operations.

On the Markov trace for Temperley--Lieb algebras of type $E_n$ - We show that there is a unique Markov trace on the tower of Temperley--Lieb type quotients of Hecke algebras of Coxeter type $E_n$ (for all $n \geq 6$). We explain in detail how this trace may be computed easily using tom Dieck's calculus of diagrams. As applications, we show how to use the trace to show that the diagram representation is faithful, and to compute leading coefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.

Second Order Perturbative Calculation of Quasinormal Modes of Schwarzschild Black Holes - We analytically calculate to second order the correction to the asymptotic form of quasinormal frequencies of four dimensional Schwarzschild black holes based on the monodromy analysis proposed by Motl and Neitzke. Our results are in good agreement with those obtained from numerical calculation.

Epitaxial graphene - Graphene multilayers are grown epitaxially on single crystal silicon carbide. This system is composed of several graphene layers of which the first layer is electron doped due to the built-in electric field and the other layers are essentially undoped. Unlike graphite the charge carriers show Dirac particle properties (i.e. an anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization and square root field dependence of the Landau level energies). Epitaxial graphene shows quasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which may persists above cryogenic temperatures. Paradoxically, in contrast to exfoliated graphene, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in high mobility epitaxial graphene. It appears that the effect is suppressed due to absence of localized states in the bulk of the material.Epitaxial graphene can be patterned using standard lithography methods and characterized using a wide array of techniques. These favorable features indicate that interconnected room temperature ballistic devices may be feasible for low dissipation high-speed nanoelectronics.

Mathematics of thermoacoustic tomography - The paper presents a survey of mathematical problems, techniques, and challenges arising in the Thermoacoustic and Photoacoustic Tomography.

Search for Very High Energy Emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts using Milagro - Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected at GeV energies by EGRET and models predict emission at > 100 GeV. Milagro is a wide field (2 sr) high duty cycle (> 90 %) ground based water Cherenkov detector that records extensive air showers in the energy range 100 GeV to 100 TeV. We have searched for very high energy emission from a sample of 106 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detected since the beginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. No evidence for emission from any of the bursts has been found and we present upper limits from these bursts.

Specific heat and bimodality in canonical and grand canonical versions of the thermodynamic model - We address two issues in the thermodynamic model for nuclear disassembly. Surprisingly large differences in results for specific heat were seen in predictions from the canonical and grand canonical ensembles when the nuclear system passes from liquid-gas co-existence to the pure gas phase. We are able to pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when they appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics addressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in the canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand canonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the issue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that this distribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. The relationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.

Vortex proliferation in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless regime on a two-dimensional lattice of Bose-Einstein condensates - We observe the proliferation of vortices in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless regime on a two-dimensional array of Josephson-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. As long as the Josephson (tunneling) energy J exceeds the thermal energy T, the array is vortex-free. With decreasing J/T, vortices appear in the system in ever greater numbers. We confirm thermal activation as the vortex formation mechanism and obtain information on the size of bound vortex pairs as J/T is varied.

The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations - We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time -- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase (occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial binary content of globular clusters.

Approaching the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser - We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.

A practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm - Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any 'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some multi-jet observables.

Isospin breaking in the yield of heavy meson pairs in e+e- annihilation near threshold - We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulomb interaction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\bar B}$ and $D {\bar D}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We consider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospin I=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. We find that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scattering phase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\bar K}$ production at the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phases in both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the same approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference between the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering effects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect of this mass difference.

QED x QCD Resummation and Shower/ME Matching for LHC Physics - We present the theory of QED x QCD resummation and its interplay with shower/matrix element matching in precision LHC physics scenarios. We illustrate the theory using single heavy gauge boson production at hadron colliders.

On the number of topological types occurring in a parametrized family of arrangements - Let ${\mathcal S}(\R)$ be an o-minimal structure over $\R$, $T \subset \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}$ a closed definable set, and $$ \displaylines{\pi_1: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{k_1 + k_2}, \pi_2: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{\ell}, \ \pi_3: \R^{k_1 + k_2} \to \R^{k_2}} $$ the projection maps. For any collection ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of subsets of $\R^{k_1+k_2}$, and $\z \in \R^{k_2}$, let $\A_\z$ denote the collection of subsets of $\R^{k_1}$, $\{A_{1,\z},..., A_{n,\z}\}$, where $A_{i,\z} = A_i \cap \pi_3^{-1}(\z), 1 \leq i \leq n$. We prove that there exists a constant $C = C(T) > 0,$ such that for any family ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of definable sets, where each $A_i = \pi_1(T \cap \pi_2^{-1}(\y_i))$, for some $\y_i \in \R^{\ell}$, the number of distinct stable homotopy types of $\A_\z, \z \in \R^{k_2}$, is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+1)k_2},} $ while the number of distinct homotopy types is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+3)k_2}.} $ This generalizes to the general o-minimal setting, bounds of the same type proved in \cite{BV} for semi-algebraic and semi-Pfaffian families. One main technical tool used in the proof of the above results, is a topological comparison theorem which might be of independent interest in the study of arrangements.

Generalized Twistor Transform And Dualities, With A New Description of Particles With Spin, Beyond Free and Massless - A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions is constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics. Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper we present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details.

Remnant evolution after a carbon-oxygen white dwarf merger - We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium, be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

Direct Theorems in the Theory of Approximation of the Banach Space Vectors by Entire Vectors of Exponential Type - For an arbitrary operator A on a Banach space X which is a generator of C_0-group with certain growth condition at the infinity, the direct theorems on connection between the smoothness degree of a vector $x\in X$ with respect to the operator A, the order of convergence to zero of the best approximation of x by exponential type entire vectors for the operator A, and the k-module of continuity are given. Obtained results allows to acquire Jackson-type inequalities in many classic spaces of periodic functions and weighted $L_p$ spaces.

Parametrized Post-Newtonian Expansion of Chern-Simons Gravity - We investigate the weak-field, post-Newtonian expansion to the solution of the field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid source. In particular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric. We find that the PPN parameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of general relativity, with the exception of the inclusion of a new term that is proportional to the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPN vector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by the non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the corrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point particles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that the Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used by current and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters of Chern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory.

Scaling of Resistance and Electron Mean Free Path of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes - We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.

Differential Recursion and Differentially Algebraic Functions - Moore introduced a class of real-valued "recursive" functions by analogy with Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his "primitive recursive" functions, we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog computation, fails.

Spline Single-Index Prediction Model - For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.

Measurement of the Aerosol Phase Function at the Pierre Auger Observatory - Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the extensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF) light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.

The World as Evolving Information - This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information, especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition, are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently as information becoming more complex. The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic, psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.

Polymerization Force Driven Buckling of Microtubule Bundles Determines the Wavelength of Patterns Formed in Tubulin Solutions - We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.

Neutron Inelastic Scattering Processes as Background for Double-Beta Decay Experiments - We investigate several Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) and Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions. We measure $\gamma$-ray production from Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions that can be a significant background for double-beta decay experiments which use lead as a massive inner shield. Particularly worrisome for Ge-based double-beta decay experiments are the 2041-keV and 3062-keV $\gamma$ rays produced via Pb$(n,n'\gamma$). The former is very close to the ^{76}Ge double-beta decay endpoint energy and the latter has a double escape peak energy near the endpoint. Excitation $\gamma$-ray lines from Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions are also observed. We consider the contribution of such backgrounds and their impact on the sensitivity of next-generation searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay using enriched germanium detectors.

Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E - Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16 +/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13 days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the timescale over which they might form planets.

Effect of node deleting on network structure - The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes. Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition, it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering coefficient in a network.

The Complexity of HCP in Digraps with Degree Bound Two - The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) in digraphs D with degree bound two is solved by two mappings in this paper. The first bijection is between an incidence matrix C_{nm} of simple digraph and an incidence matrix F of balanced bipartite undirected graph G; The second mapping is from a perfect matching of G to a cycle of D. It proves that the complexity of HCP in D is polynomial, and finding a second non-isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle from a given Hamiltonian digraph with degree bound two is also polynomial. Lastly it deduces P=NP base on the results.

VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum radio sources at 1.6 GHz - Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources are selected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are from our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS sources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the absorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources. Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for the first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicating that they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us. This result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources (or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232, J2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showing double-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Three sources J1057+0012, J1600-0037 and J1753+2750 are considered as core-jet sources according to their morphologies and flux variability.

Moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes - A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force microscopy (MFM) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex of conventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer. Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here we demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.

Power Spectra to 1% Accuracy between Dynamical Dark Energy Cosmologies - For dynamical dark energy cosmologies we carry out a series of N-body gravitational simulations, achieving percent level accuracy in the relative mass power spectra at any redshift. Such accuracy in the power spectrum is necessary for next generation cosmological mass probes. Our matching procedure reproduces the CMB distance to last scattering and delivers subpercent level power spectra at z=0 and z~3. We discuss the physical implications for probing dark energy with surveys of large scale structure.

Possibility of Gapless Spin Liquid State by One-dimensionalization - Motivated by the observation of a gapless spin liquid state in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, we analyze the anisotropic triangular lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model with the resonating valence bond mean-field approximation. Paying attention to the small quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy of the material, we take an approach from one-dimensional (1D) chains coupled with frustrating zig-zag bonds. By calculating one-particle excitation spectra changing anisotropy parameter $J'/J$ from the decoupled 1D chains to the isotropic triangular lattice, we find almost gapless excitations in the wide range from the 1D limit. This one-dimensionalization by frustration is considered to be a candidate for the mechanism of the gapless spin liquid state.

Extra dimensions and Lorentz invariance violation - We consider effective model where photons interact with scalar field corresponding to conformal excitations of the internal space (geometrical moduli/gravexcitons). We demonstrate that this interaction results in a modified dispersion relation for photons, and consequently, the photon group velocity depends on the energy implying the propagation time delay effect. We suggest to use the experimental bounds of the time delay of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) photons propagation as an additional constrain for the gravexciton parameters.

The small deviations of many-dimensional diffusion processes and rarefaction by boundaries - We lead the algorithm of expansion of sojourn probability of many-dimensional diffusion processes in small domain. The principal member of this expansion defines normalizing coefficient for special limit theorems.

The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: The local supermassive black hole mass function in early- and late-type galaxies - We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function using (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the Sersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured (spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope (1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh, early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive black hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70. That is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003) h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.

Complete Shrinking Ricci Solitons have Finite Fundamental Group - We show that if a complete Riemannian manifold supports a vector field such that the Ricci tensor plus the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to the vector field has a positive lower bound, then the fundamental group is finite. In particular, it follows that complete shrinking Ricci solitons and complete smooth metric measure spaces with a positive lower bound on the Bakry-Emery tensor have finite fundamental group. The method of proof is to generalize arguments of Garcia-Rio and Fernandez-Lopez in the compact case.

Effects of Dirac sea on pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter - We study pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM). One of the interesting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for the different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon dynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS) $\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect of the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the chiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is included by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective field theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the previous calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed form analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and dispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and suitable density expansion.

Spin-orbit coupling effect on the persistent currents in mesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity - Based on the finite $U$ slave boson method, we have investigated the effect of Rashba spin-orbit(SO) coupling on the persistent charge and spin currents in mesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. It is shown that the Kondo effect will decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this side-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the persistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO coupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt jumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spin current circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in this system.

Probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations - Fractional calculus allows one to generalize the linear, one-dimensional, diffusion equation by replacing either the first time derivative or the second space derivative by a derivative of fractional order. The fundamental solutions of these equations provide probability density functions, evolving on time or variable in space, which are related to the class of stable distributions. This property is a noteworthy generalization of what happens for the standard diffusion equation and can be relevant in treating financial and economical problems where the stable probability distributions play a key role.

Fabrication of half metallicity in a ferromagnetic metal - We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic material using state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method. To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials. This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based technology.

Emergence of spatiotemporal chaos driven by far-field breakup of spiral waves in the plankton ecological systems - Alexander B. Medvinsky \emph{et al} [A. B. Medvinsky, I. A. Tikhonova, R. R. Aliev, B.-L. Li, Z.-S. Lin, and H. Malchow, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{64}, 021915 (2001)] and Marcus R. Garvie \emph{et al} [M. R. Garvie and C. Trenchea, SIAM J. Control. Optim. \textbf{46}, 775-791 (2007)] shown that the minimal spatially extended reaction-diffusion model of phytoplankton-zooplankton can exhibit both regular, chaotic behavior, and spatiotemporal patterns in a patchy environment. Based on that, the spatial plankton model is furtherly investigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in the present paper when its parameters would be expected in the case of mixed Turing-Hopf bifurcation region. Our results show that the spiral waves exist in that region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-field breakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from the far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole space within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computation spectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains. Finally, we give some explanations about the spatially structured patterns from the community level.

General sequential quantum cloning - Some multipartite quantum states can be generated in a sequential manner which may be implemented by various physical setups like microwave and optical cavity QED, trapped ions, and quantum dots etc. We analyze the general N to M qubits Universal Quantum Cloning Machine (UQCM) within a sequential generation scheme. We show that the N to M sequential UQCM is available. The case of d-level quantum states sequential cloning is also presented.

On the pseudospectrum of elliptic quadratic differential operators - We study the pseudospectrum of a class of non-selfadjoint differential operators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties, which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing under small perturbations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class of elliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators defined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols. We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the Weyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra. When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which can be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical description of them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some numerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from their spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.

Fluctuation-dissipation relation on a Melde string in a turbulent flow, considerations on a "dynamical temperature" - We report on measurements of the transverse fluctuations of a string in a turbulent air jet flow. Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating drag force, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it possible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over space and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the dissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the fluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate the concept of {\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare our observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the theory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the spectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental results are in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds number accessible ($74000 \leq Re \leq 170000$).

On generalized entropy measures and pathways - Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function. Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related differential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of "inaccuracy" is also explored.

Evolution of a band insulating phase from a correlated metallic phase - We investigate the evolution of the electronic structure in SrRu_(1-x)Ti_xO_3 as a function of x using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy, where SrRuO3 is a weakly correlated metal and SrTiO3 is a band insulator. The surface spectra exhibit a metal-insulator transition at x = 0.5 by opening up a soft gap. A hard gap appears at higher x values consistent with the transport properties. In contrast, the bulk spectra reveal a pseudogap at the Fermi level, and unusual evolution exhibiting an apparent broadening of the coherent feature and subsequent decrease in intensity of the lower Hubbard band with the increase in x. Interestingly, the first principle approaches are found to be sufficient to capture anomalous evolutions at high energy scale. Analysis of the spectral lineshape indicates strong interplay between disorder and electron correlation in the electronic properties of this system.

Electroweak phase transitions in the MSSM with an extra $U(1)'$ - We investigate the possibility of electroweak phase transition in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with an extra $U(1)'$. This model has two Higgs doublets and a singlet, in addition to a singlet exotic quark superfield. We find that at the one-loop level this model may accommodate the electroweak phase transitions that are strongly first-order in a reasonably large region of the parameter space. In the parameter region where the phase transitions take place, we observe that the lightest scalar Higgs boson has a smaller mass when the strength of the phase transition becomes weaker. Also, the other three heavier neutral Higgs bosons get more large masses when the strength of the phase transition becomes weaker.

Solutions of fractional reaction-diffusion equations in terms of the H-function - This paper deals with the investigation of the solution of an unified fractional reaction-diffusion equation associated with the Caputo derivative as the time-derivative and Riesz-Feller fractional derivative as the space-derivative. The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace and Fourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The results derived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier by many authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamental solution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al. (2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of using Riesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional reaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental solution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization of neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and time-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be interpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are expressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.

Random Matrix Theory at Nonzero $\mu$ and $T$ - We review applications of random matrix theory to QCD at nonzero temperature and chemical potential. The chiral phase transition of QCD and QCD-like theories is discussed in terms of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. We show that for QCD at $\mu \ne 0$, which has a sign problem, the discontinuity in the chiral condensate is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher relation. The severity of the sign problem is analyzed in the microscopic domain of QCD.

Symmetries by base substitutions in the genetic code predict 2' or 3' aminoacylation of tRNAs - This letter reports complete sets of two-fold symmetries between partitions of the universal genetic code. By substituting bases at each position of the codons according to a fixed rule, it happens that properties of the degeneracy pattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity are exchanged.

The effect of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the conservation of energy in a four dimensional Universe - The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors. The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar, which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics, and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework. The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and (ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the speed of light to the mass of the Universe.

Optical properties of the Holstein-t-J model from dynamical mean-field theory - We employ dynamical mean-field theory to study the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ of one hole in the Holstein-t-J model. We provide an exact solution for $\sigma(\omega)$ in the limit of infinite connectivity. We apply our analysis to Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We show that our model can explain many features of the optical conductivity in this compounds in terms of magnetic/lattice polaron formation.

A Multiphilic Descriptor for Chemical Reactivity and Selectivity - In line with the local philicity concept proposed by Chattaraj et al. (Chattaraj, P. K.; Maiti, B.; Sarkar, U. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003, 107, 4973) and a dual descriptor derived by Toro-Labbe and coworkers (Morell, C.; Grand, A.; Toro-Labbe, A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205), we propose a multiphilic descriptor. It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic (Wk+) and electrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable of simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the given atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the path of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor has been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions. Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases. Also, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another related descriptor namely, the nucleophilicity excess (DelW-+) for a nucleophile, over the electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all-metal aromatic compounds.

Approximation of the distribution of a stationary Markov process with application to option pricing - We build a sequence of empirical measures on the space D(R_+,R^d) of R^d-valued c\`adl\`ag functions on R_+ in order to approximate the law of a stationary R^d-valued Markov and Feller process (X_t). We obtain some general results of convergence of this sequence. Then, we apply them to Brownian diffusions and solutions to L\'evy driven SDE's under some Lyapunov-type stability assumptions. As a numerical application of this work, we show that this procedure gives an efficient way of option pricing in stochastic volatility models.

Influence of Phonon dimensionality on Electron Energy Relaxation - We studied experimentally the role of phonon dimensionality on electron-phonon (e-p) interaction in thin copper wires evaporated either on suspended silicon nitride membranes or on bulk substrates, at sub-Kelvin temperatures. The power emitted from electrons to phonons was measured using sensitive normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) tunnel junction thermometers. Membrane thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 750 nm were used to clearly see the onset of the effects of two-dimensional (2D) phonon system. We observed for the first time that a 2D phonon spectrum clearly changes the temperature dependence and strength of the e-p scattering rate, with the interaction becoming stronger at the lowest temperatures below $\sim$ 0.5 K for the 30 nm membranes.

Bursting Dynamics of the 3D Euler Equations in Cylindrical Domains - A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large vorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. The fast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied for parametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami waves deplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems of three-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of these resonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of these homoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolev norms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.

Synergistic Effects of MoDTC and ZDTP on Frictional Behaviour of Tribofilms at the Nanometer Scale - The layered structure and the rheological properties of anti-wear films, generated in a rolling/sliding contact from lubricants containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) and/or molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC) additives, have been studied by dynamic nanoindentation experiments coupled with a simple modelling of the stiffness measurements. Local nano-friction experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure in the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction coefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 < $\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm. This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.

Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations - In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations, i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}). The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations \textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial compressibility method are discussed.

Phonon-mediated decay of an atom in a surface-induced potential - We study phonon-mediated transitions between translational levels of an atom in a surface-induced potential. We present a general master equation governing the dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the Debye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and downward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of bound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels. Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones. We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400 $\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the adsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the heating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free downward decay) rate is negligible.

Infrared Evolution Equations: Method and Applications - It is a brief review on composing and solving Infrared Evolution Equations. They can be used in order to calculate amplitudes of high-energy reactions in different kinematic regions in the double-logarithmic approximation.

Cofibrations in the Category of Frolicher Spaces. Part I - Cofibrations are defined in the category of Fr\"olicher spaces by weakening the analog of the classical definition to enable smooth homotopy extensions to be more easily constructed, using flattened unit intervals. We later relate smooth cofibrations to smooth neighborhood deformation retracts. The notion of smooth neighborhood deformation retract gives rise to an analogous result that a closed Fr\"olicher subspace $A$ of the Fr\"olicher space $X$ is a smooth neighborhood deformation retract of $X$ if and only if the inclusion $i: A\hookrightarrow X$ comes from a certain subclass of cofibrations. As an application we construct the right Puppe sequence.

Experimental observation of structural crossover in binary mixtures of colloidal hard spheres - Using confocal-microscopy we investigate the structure of binary mixtures of colloidal hard spheres with size ratio q=0.61. As a function of the packing fraction of the two particle species, we observe a marked change of the dominant wavelength in the pair correlation function. This behavior is in excellent agreement with a recently predicted structural crossover in such mixtures. In addition, the repercussions of structural crossover on the real-space structure of a binary fluid are analyzed. We suggest a relation between crossover and the lateral extension of networks containing only equally sized particles that are connected by nearest neighbor bonds. This is supported by Monte-Carlo simulations which are performed at different packing fractions and size ratios.

The Blazar Spectral Sequence and GLAST - The present status and understanding of the "spectral sequence" of blazars is discussed in the perspective of the upcoming GLAST launch. The vast improvement in sensitivity will allow to i) determine more objectively the "average" gamma-ray properties of classes objects ii) probe more deeply the ratio between accretion power and jet power in different systems.

A High Robustness and Low Cost Model for Cascading Failures - We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially created scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid. The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of the load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simple functional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly important for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading failures.

Diffuse X-ray Emission from the Carina Nebula Observed with Suzaku - A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray emission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse emission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by collisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O stars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from massive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown. The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for extended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key emission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side of the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra of the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines of iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core these lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal plasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3 abundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might originate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.

Resolvent estimates related with a class of dispersive equations - We present a simple proof of the resolvent estimates of elliptic Fourier multipliers on the Euclidean space, and apply them to the analysis of time-global and spatially-local smoothing estimates of a class of dispersive equations. For this purpose we study in detail the properties of the restriction of Fourier transform on the unit cotangent sphere associated with the symbols of multipliers.

The Colin de Verdi\`ere number and graphs of polytopes - The Colin de Verdi\`ere number $\mu(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum corank of a Colin de Verdi\`ere matrix for $G$ (that is, of a Schr\"odinger operator on $G$ with a single negative eigenvalue). In 2001, Lov\'asz gave a construction that associated to every convex 3-polytope a Colin de Verdi\`ere matrix of corank 3 for its 1-skeleton. We generalize the Lov\'asz construction to higher dimensions by interpreting it as minus the Hessian matrix of the volume of the polar dual. As a corollary, $\mu(G) \ge d$ if $G$ is the 1-skeleton of a convex $d$-polytope. Determination of the signature of the Hessian of the volume is based on the second Minkowski inequality for mixed volumes and on Bol's condition for equality.

Visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of Jupiter Trojans: final results on dynamical families - We present the results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of Jupiter Trojans belonging to different dynamical families carried out at the ESO-NTT telescope. We obtained data on 47 objects, 23 belonging to the L5 swarm and 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published by Fornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of visible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six families (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5 cloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The sample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception of the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and P-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the exception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is detected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property distributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in comparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System. Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher inclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.

FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, V. Milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS objects - Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in a sample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. The sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics of radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or possibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made using MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7, 5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are presented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of the sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a complicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One of the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs, extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The young age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution scenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux of 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.

Investigation of relaxation phenomena in high-temperature superconductors HoBa2Cu3O7-d at the action of pulsed magnetic fields - It is used the mechanical method of Abrikosov vortex stimulated dynamics investigation in superconductors. With its help it was studied relaxation phenomena in vortex matter of high-temperature superconductors. It established that pulsed magnetic fields change the course of relaxation processes taking place in vortex matter. The study of the influence of magnetic pulses differing by their durations and amplitudes on vortex system of isotropic high-temperature superconductors system HoBa2Cu3O7-d showed the presence of threshold phenomena. The small duration pulses does not change the course of relaxation processes taking place in vortex matter. When the duration of pulses exceeds some critical value (threshold), then their influence change the course of relaxation process which is revealed by stepwise change of relaxing mechanical moment . These investigations showed that the time for formatting of Abrikosov vortex lattice in HoBa2Cu3O7-d is of the order of 20 microsec. which on the order of value exceeds the time necessary for formation of a single vortex observed in type II superconductors.

Spin and pseudospin symmetries and the equivalent spectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles - We show that the conditions which originate the spin and pseudospin symmetries in the Dirac equation are the same that produce equivalent energy spectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles in the presence of vector and scalar potentials. The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapes of the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. When both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for isospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper component or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making it equivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case, besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular momentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper or lower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle. We point out a few possible applications of this result.

General asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations and phase transitions in quantum gravity - We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.

Trigonometric parallaxes of high velocity halo white dwarf candidates - The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al. (2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo dark matter residing in such objects. We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August 2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for 3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a subsequent publication.

AMR simulations of the low T/|W| bar-mode instability of neutron stars - It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode deformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations, performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low T/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability, which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.

Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations - Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's dilemma and also of the "rock-paper-scissor" game we find indications of rich structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and the emergence of global oscillations.

Flavor Physics in SUSY at large tan(beta) - We discuss the phenomenological impact of a particularly interesting corner of the MSSM: the large tan(beta) regime. The capabilities of leptonic and hadronic Flavor Violating processes in shedding light on physics beyond the Standard Model are reviewed. Moreover, we show that tests of Lepton Universality in charged current processes can represent an interesting handle to obtain relevant information on New Physics scenarios.

Some properties of the complex Monge-Ampere operator in Cegrell's classes and applications - In this article we will first prove a result about convergence in capacity. Using the achieved result we will obtain a general decompositon theorem for complex Monge-Ampere measues which will be used to prove a comparison principle for the complex Monge-Ampere operator.

Torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops - We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies and wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops. Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a development of coronal seismology.

Pseudo-random Puncturing: A Technique to Lower the Error Floor of Turbo Codes - It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its error floor.

The Arctic Circle Revisited - The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlation function, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of this correlation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant and multiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapes of the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we show that for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase diagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model with a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-point analysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and its generalization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.

Time and motion in physics: the Reciprocity Principle, relativistic invariance of the lengths of rulers and time dilatation - Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper' and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications. A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out

B --> rho K* decays and other rare vector-vector modes - The recent analyses of the following rare vector-vector decays of the B meson are presented: rho K*, omega K*, omega rho, omega omega, and omega phi charmless final states. The latest results indicate that the fraction of longitudinal polarization is about 0.5 in penguin-dominated modes and close to 1 for tree-dominated modes.

Extending the theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in quasi-2D - I present results from an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory of electron-phonon interactions and superconductivity. The history of the electron-phonon problem is introduced, and then study of the intermediate parameter regime is justified from the energy scales in the cuprate superconductors. The Holstein model is detailed, and limiting cases are examined to demonstrate the need for an extended theory of superconductivity. Results of the extended approximation are shown, including spectral functions and phase diagrams. These are discussed with reference to Hohenberg's theorem, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and Coulomb repulsion.

Generalized Nariai Solutions for Yang-type Monopoles - A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalized Yang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those which present black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system is thermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons to coalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shown that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new spacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radii of spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type term should be present in the line element or not, are also included.

Instanton representation of Plebanski gravity. Consistency of the initital value constraints under time evolution - The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity provides as equations of motion a Hodge self-duality condition and a set of `generalized' Maxwell's equations, subject to gravitational degrees of freedom encoded in the initial value constraints of general relativity. The main result of the present paper will be to prove that this constraint surface is preserved under time evolution. We carry this out not using the usual Dirac procedure, but rather the Lagrangian equations of motion themsleves. Finally, we provide a comparison with the Ashtekar formulation to place these results into overall context.

Metal-insulator transition in the low-dimensional organic conductor (TMTSF)2FSO3 probed by infrared microspectroscopy - We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (E||a) and perpendicular (E||b') to the stacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulator transition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show a Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1 (185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the optical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations gives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the transition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the lattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new infrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which has so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a metal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between the TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment of the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of the new mode.

The effect of Topcolor Assisted Technicolor, and other models, on Neutrino Oscillation - New physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects on neutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the three flavors of neutrino. In Ref.1, we argued that a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its high-energy mode is aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be capable of constraining the size of those extra matter effects, provided the vacuum value of \sin^2 2\theta_{23} is not too close to one. In this talk, we discuss how such a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants and masses of new particles in models such as topcolor assisted technicolor.

Shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque and microwave generation without magnetic field - The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the spin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurements on specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence of the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical models. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also predicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This type of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the implementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate microwave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize the theoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of the torque.

Dark energy interacting with neutrinos and dark matter: a phenomenological theory - A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.

Levy-Lieb constrained-search formulation as a minimization of the correlation functional - The constrained-search formulation of Levy and Lieb, which formally defines the exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional for any N-representable electron density, is here shown to be equivalent to the minimization of the correlation functional with respect to the N-1 conditional probability density, where N is number of electrons of the system. The consequences and implications of such a result are here analyzed and discussed via a practical example.

Reality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound states - In quantum mechanics textbooks the momentum operator is defined in the Cartesian coordinates and rarely the form of the momentum operator in spherical polar coordinates is discussed. Consequently one always generalizes the Cartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this work we introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentum operator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out most of the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator, which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum expectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value really turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum expectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular variables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as dynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation of motion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.

Gravity-induced electric polarization of matter and planetary magnetic fields - This paper has been withdrawn due to copyright reasons.

Rich methane premixed laminar flames doped by light unsaturated hydrocarbons - Part I : allene and propyne - The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a pure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne, respectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane and 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure methane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant, with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration profiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling with a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne, allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene, 1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from 700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results, some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6 aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.

Environmental noise reduction for holonomic quantum gates - We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser. For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that for a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in terms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) gates.

The lifetime of unstable particles in electromagnetic fields - We show that the electromagnetic moments of unstable particles (resonances) have an absorptive contribution which quantifies the change of the particle's lifetime in an external electromagnetic field. To give an example we compute here the imaginary part of the magnetic moment for the cases of the muon and the neutron at leading order in the electroweak coupling. We also consider an analogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result for the muon is Im$ \mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$ the mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic field of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of $3\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We speculate on the observable implications of this effect.

An equilibrium problem for the limiting eigenvalue distribution of banded Toeplitz matrices - We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $n\times n$ banded Toeplitz matrices as $n\to \infty$. From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer and Hirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in the complex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weakly to a measure on this curve as $n\to\infty$. In this paper, we characterize the limiting measure in terms of an equilibrium problem. The limiting measure is one component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energy functional defined on admissible vectors of measures. In addition, we show that each of the other components is the limiting measure of the normalized counting measure on certain generalized eigenvalues.

Capturing knots in polymers - This paper visualizes a knot reduction algorithm

Exponential growth rates in a typed branching diffusion - We study the high temperature phase of a family of typed branching diffusions initially studied in [Ast\'{e}risque 236 (1996) 133--154] and [Lecture Notes in Math. 1729 (2000) 239--256 Springer, Berlin]. The primary aim is to establish some almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particle system, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes both space and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population grows within this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of an explicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient numbers with spatial positions near $-\gamma t$ and type positions near $\kappa \sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety of martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a change of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's intrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt to other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to traveling wave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.

The collision velocity of the bullet cluster in conventional and modified dynamics - We consider the orbit of the bullet cluster 1E 0657-56 in both CDM and MOND using accurate mass models appropriate to each case in order to ascertain the maximum plausible collision velocity. Impact velocities consistent with the shock velocity (~ 4700km/s) occur naturally in MOND. CDM can generate collision velocities of at most ~ 3800km/s, and is only consistent with the data provided that the shock velocity has been substantially enhanced by hydrodynamical effects.

On Some Subgroup Chains Related to Kneser's Theorem - A recent result of Balandraud shows that for every subset S of an abelian group G, there exists a non trivial subgroup H such that |TS| <= |T|+|S|-2 holds only if the stabilizer of TS contains H. Notice that Kneser's Theorem says only that the stabilizer of TS must be a non-zero subgroup. This strong form of Kneser's theorem follows from some nice properties of a certain poset investigated by Balandraud. We consider an analogous poset for nonabelian groups and, by using classical tools from Additive Number Theory, extend some of the above results. In particular we obtain short proofs of Balandraud's results in the abelian case.

The Exact Boundary Condition to Solve the Schrodinger Equation of Many Electron System - In an attempt to bypass the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation of electronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive the exclusion principle "Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotential surface simultaneously" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We propose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundary condition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the non-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition was applied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground state energies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativistic energies.

Clustering features of $^9$Be, $^{14}$N, $^7$Be, and $^8$B nuclei in relativistic fragmentation - Recent studies of clustering in light nuclei with an initial energy above 1 A GeV in nuclear treack emulsion are overviewed. The results of investigations of the relativistic $^9$Be nuclei fragmentation in emulsion, which entails the production of He fragments, are presented. It is shown that most precise angular measurements provided by this technique play a crucial role in the restoration of the excitation spectrum of the $\alpha$ particle sysytem. In peripheral interactions $^9$Be nuclei are dissociated practically totally through the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states of the $^8$Be nucleus. The results of investigations of the dissociation of a $^{14}$N nucleus of momentum 2.86 A GeV/c in emulsion are presented as example of more complicated system. The momentum and correlation characteristics of $\alpha$ particles for the $^{14}$N$\to3\alpha+X$ channel in the laboratory system and the rest systems of 3$\alpha$ particles were considered in detail. Topology of charged fragments produced in peripheral relativistic dissociation of radioactive $^8$B, $^7$Be nuclei in emulsion is studied.

Super-shell structures and pairing in ultracold trapped Fermi gases - We calculate level densities and pairing gaps for an ultracold dilute gas of fermionic atoms in harmonic traps under the influence of mean field and anharmonic quartic trap potentials. Super-shell structures, which were found in Hartree-Fock calculations, are calculated analytically within periodic orbit theory as well as from WKB calculations. For attractive interactions, the underlying level densities are crucial for pairing and super-shell structures in gaps are predicted.

Quantum non-local effects with Bose-Einstein condensates - We study theoretically the properties of two Bose-Einstein condensates in different spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individual measurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse directions, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially, this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random results. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of the successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation where all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of measurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects show up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The violation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may be comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.

Low mass visual binaries in the solar neighbourhood: The case of HD141272 - We search for stellar and substellar companions of young nearby stars to investigate stellar multiplicity and formation of stellar and substellar companions. We detect common proper-motion companions of stars via multi-epoch imaging. Their companionship is finally confirmed with photometry and spectroscopy. Here we report the discovery of a new co-moving (13 sigma) stellar companion ~17.8 arcsec (350 AU in projected separation) north of the nearby star HD141272 (21 pc). With EMMI/NTT optical spectroscopy we determined the spectral type of the companion to be M3+-0.5V. The derived spectral type as well as the near infrared photometry of the companion are both fully consistent with a 0.26+-0.07 Msol dwarf located at the distance of HD141272 (21 pc). Furthermore the photometry data rules out the pre-main sequence status, since the system is consistent with the ZAMS of the Pleiades.

Sterile neutrinos at the CNGS - We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter space of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an $\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux. Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of $\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on $\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible existence of sterile neutrinos.

Evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole: effect of the black hole quadrupole - We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio. This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio, to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

Dual billiards, Fagnano orbits and regular polygons - We study the notion of Fagnano orbits for dual polygonal billiards. We used them to characterize regular polygons and we study the iteration of the developing map.

Exactly solvable spin dynamics of an electron coupled to large number of nuclei and the electron-nuclear spin echo in a quantum dot - The model considered in the paper is used nowadays to describe spin dynamics of quantum dots after optical excitation. Based on the exact diagonalization of a model Hamiltonian, we solve the problems of the electron spin polarization decay and magnetic field dependence of the steady state polarization. The important role of the nuclear state is shown and methods of its calculation for different regimes of optical excitation are proposed. The effect of spin echo observed after application of the magnetic field $\pi$-pulse is predicted.

Simulation of Robustness against Lesions of Cortical Networks - Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain will help to understand its function and may provide insights into many properties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to their dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random (exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology, hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks' connectivity.

A thermodynamic model for the melting of supported metal nanoparticles - We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with and without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature of a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle with the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the case when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are similar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting begins.

Average optimality for risk-sensitive control with general state space - This paper deals with discrete-time Markov control processes on a general state space. A long-run risk-sensitive average cost criterion is used as a performance measure. The one-step cost function is nonnegative and possibly unbounded. Using the vanishing discount factor approach, the optimality inequality and an optimal stationary strategy for the decision maker are established.

A Study of $B_{d}^0 \to J/\Psi \eta^{(\prime)}$ Decays in the pQCD Approach - Motivated by the very recent measurement of the branching ratio of ${B_d^0} \to J/\psi \eta$ decay, we calculate the branching ratios of ${B_d}^0 \to J/\psi \eta$ and ${B_d}^0 \to J/\Psi \eta'$ decays in the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach. The pQCD predictions for the branching ratios of considered decays are: $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta) = (1.96 ^{+9.68}_{-0.65}) \times 10^{-6}$, which is consistent with the first experimental measurement within errors; while $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta') = (1.09 ^{+3.76}_{-0.25}) \times 10^{-6}$, very similar with $B_d^0 \to \jpsi \eta$ decay and can be tested by the forthcoming LHC experiments. The measurements of these decay channels may help us to understand the QCD dynamics in the corresponding energy scale, especially the reliability of pQCD approach to these kinds of B meson decays.

Finite-temperature phase transitions in a two-dimensional boson Hubbard model - We study finite-temperature phase transitions in a two-dimensional boson Hubbard model with zero-point quantum fluctuations via Monte Carlo simulations of quantum rotor model, and construct the corresponding phase diagram. Compressibility shows a thermally activated gapped behavior in the insulating regime. Finite-size scaling of the superfluid stiffness clearly shows the nature of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The transition temperature, $T_c$, confirms a scaling relation $T_c \propto \rho_0^x$ with $x=1.0$. Some evidences of anomalous quantum behavior at low temperatures are presented.

Conditional generation of path-entangled optical NOON states - We propose a measurement protocol to generate path-entangled NOON states conditionally from two pulsed type II optical parametric oscillators. We calculate the fidelity of the produced states and the success probability of the protocol. The trigger detectors are assumed to have finite dead time, and for short pulse trigger fields they are modeled as on/off detectors with finite efficiency. Continuous-wave operation of the parametric oscillators is also considered.

Renewals for exponentially increasing lifetimes, with an application to digital search trees - We show that the number of renewals up to time $t$ exhibits distributional fluctuations as $t\to\infty$ if the underlying lifetimes increase at an exponential rate in a distributional sense. This provides a probabilistic explanation for the asymptotics of insertion depth in random trees generated by a bit-comparison strategy from uniform input; we also obtain a representation for the resulting family of limit laws along subsequences. Our approach can also be used to obtain rates of convergence.

Hawking radiation of linear dilaton black holes - We compute exactly the semi-classical radiation spectrum for a class of non-asymptotically flat charged dilaton black holes, the so-called linear dilaton black holes. In the high frequency regime, the temperature for these black holes generically agrees with the surface gravity result. In the special case where the black hole is massless, we show that, although the surface gravity remains finite, there is no radiation, in agreement with the fact that massless objects cannot radiate.

The S-Matrix of AdS/CFT and Yangian Symmetry - We review the algebraic construction of the S-matrix of AdS/CFT. We also present its symmetry algebra which turns out to be a Yangian of the centrally extended su(2|2) superalgebra.

Modelling the Near-IR Spectra of Red Supergiant-dominated Populations - We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of young stellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants (RSGs) are dominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGs using fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra; RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of the microturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictions are then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young star clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers. We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.

Locating the peaks of least-energy solutions to a quasilinear elliptic Neumann problem - In this paper we study the shape of least-energy solutions to a singularly perturbed quasilinear problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. We use an intrinsic variation method to show that at limit, the global maximum point of least-energy solutions goes to a point on the boundary faster than the linear rate and this point on the boundary approaches to a point where the mean curvature of the boundary achieves its maximum. We also give a complete proof of exponential decay of least-energy solutions.

Review: Semiconductor Quantum Light Sources - Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.

To the origin of the difference of FSI phases in $B\to\pi\pi$ and $B\to\rho\rho$ decays - The final state interactions (FSI) model in which soft rescattering of low mass intermediate states dominates is suggested. It explains why the strong interaction phases are large in the $B_d\to\pi\pi$ channel and are considerably smaller in the $B_d\to\rho\rho$ one. Direct CP asymmetries of $B_d\to\pi\pi$ decays which are determined by FSI phases are considered as well.

An invariance principle for semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions in domains with piecewise smooth boundaries - Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of domains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic networks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and directions of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the polyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries and possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.

Finite Drude weight for 1D low temperature conductors - We apply well established finite temperature Quantum Monte Carlo techniques to one dimensional Bose systems with soft and hardcore constraint, as well as to spinless fermion systems. We give clear and robust numerical evidence that, as expected, no superfluid density for Bosons or Meissner fraction for fermions. is possible at {\em any} non zero temperature in one dimensional interacting Bose or fermi lattice models, whereas a finite Drude weight is generally observed in gapless systems, in partial disagreement to previous expectations.

Density dependent hadronic models and the relation between neutron stars and neutron skin thickness - In the present work we investigate the main differences in the lead neutron skin thickness, binding energy, surface energy and density profiles obtained with two different density dependent relativistic hadronic models, within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that the asymmetry parameter for low momentum transfer polarized electron scattering is not sensitive to the model parametrization differences.

Photoconductance of organic single-molecule contacts - We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large enhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant levels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a length-independent value in the presence of radiation.

On the over-barrier reflection in quantum mechanics with multiple degrees of freedom - We present an analytic example of two dimensional quantum mechanical system, where the exponential suppression of the probability of over-barrier reflection changes non-monotonically with energy. The suppression is minimal at certain "optimal" energies where reflection occurs with exponentially larger probability than at other energies.

Cyclotron Resonance study of the electron and hole velocity in graphene monolayers - We report studies of cyclotron resonance in monolayer graphene. Cyclotron resonance is detected using the photoconductive response of the sample for several different Landau level occupancies. The experiments measure an electron velocity at the K- (Dirac) point of $c_{K}^{*}$ = 1.093 x 10$^{6}$ ms$^{-1}$ and in addition detect a significant asymmetry between the electron and hole bands, leading to a difference in the electron and hole velocities of 5% by energies of 125 meV away from the Dirac point.

Molecular circuits based on graphene nano-ribbon junctions - Graphene nano-ribbons junctions based electronic devices are proposed in this Letter. Non-equilibrium Green function calculations show that nano-ribbon junctions tailored from single layer graphene with different edge shape and width can act as metal-semiconductor junctions and quantum dots can be implemented. In virtue of the possibilities of patterning monolayer graphene down to atomic precision, these structures, quite different from the previously reported two-dimensional bulk graphene or carbon nanotube devices, are expected to be used as the building blocks of the future nano-electronics.

Unit groups of integral finite group rings with no noncyclic abelian finite subgroups - It is shown that in the units of augmentation one of an integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ of a finite group $G$, a noncyclic subgroup of order $p^{2}$, for some odd prime $p$, exists only if such a subgroup exists in $G$. The corresponding statement for $p=2$ holds by the Brauer--Suzuki theorem, as recently observed by W. Kimmerle.

Exotic Hadron in Pole-dominated QCD Sum Rules - We study pentaquark $\Theta^{+} (I=0,J=1/2)$ in the QCD sum rules emphasizing that we can not extract any properties of the pentaquark outside of the Borel window. To find the appropriate Borel window, we prepare a favorable set up of the correlators and carry out the operator product expansion up to dimension 15 within factorization hypothesis. Our procedures reduce the unwanted high energy contaminations and enhance the low energy correlation. In the Borel window, independent analyses for the chiral-even and odd sum rules give the consistent values of the $\Theta^+$ mass, $1.68\pm0.22$ GeV, and the residue. The parity is found to be {\it positive}.

Leaky modes of a left-handed slab - Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability) so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.

Coulomb blockade of field emission from nanoscale conductors - Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscale objects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field- emission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electron charging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric field responsible for the field emission. A detailed consideration of the current-voltage characteristics is carried out for a nanocluster modelled by a metallic spherical particle in the close vicinity of the cathode and for a cylindrical silicon nanowire grown on the cathode surface.

Origamis with non congruence Veech groups - As main result we show that for each g > 1 there is some translation surface of genus g whose Veech group is a non congruence subgroup of SL(2,Z). We use origamis/square-tiled surfaces to produce our examples. The article is divided into two parts: In the first part we introduce translation surfaces, origamis, Veech groups and Teichmueller curves and show for two origamis in genus 2 that their Veech groups are non congruence groups; in the second part we provide a technique that produces sequences of origamis whose Veech groups are decreasing. This is used to prove the main result.

Thermodynamic Stability - A note on a footnote in Ruelle's book - Thermodynamic stable interaction pair potentials which are not of the form ``positive function + real continuous function of positive type'' are presented in dimension one. Construction of such a potential in dimension two is sketched. These constructions use only elementary calculations. The mathematical background is discussed separately.

Entanglement entropy at infinite randomness fixed points in higher dimensions - The entanglement entropy of the two-dimensional random transverse Ising model is studied with a numerical implementation of the strong disorder renormalization group. The asymptotic behavior of the entropy per surface area diverges at, and only at, the quantum phase transition that is governed by an infinite randomness fixed point. Here we identify a double-logarithmic multiplicative correction to the area law for the entanglement entropy. This contrasts with the pure area law valid at the infinite randomness fixed point in the diluted transverse Ising model in higher dimensions.

Ultrasound attenuation of superfluid $^{3}$He in aerogel - We have performed longitudinal ultrasound (9.5 MHz) attenuation measurements in the B-phase of superfluid $^3$He in 98% porosity aerogel down to the zero temperature limit for a wide range of pressures at zero magnetic field. The absolute attenuation was determined by direct transmission of sound pulses. Compared to the bulk fluid, our results revealed a drastically different behavior in attenuation, which is consistent with theoretical accounts with gapless excitations and a collision drag effect.

The Hourglass - Consequences of Pure Hamiltonian Evolution of a Radiating System - Hourglass is the name given here to a formal isolated quantum system that can radiate. Starting from a time when it defines the system it represents clearly and no radiation is present, it is given straightforward Hamiltonian evolution. The question of what significance hourglasses have is raised, and this question is proposed to be more consequential than the measurement problem.

The Sigma-D Relation for Planetary Nebulae: Preliminary Analysis - An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter, so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) the theoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface brightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updated sample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect - Malmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) we conclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is not useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with unknown distances.

Polarization conversion in a silica microsphere - We experimentally demonstrate controlled polarization-selective phenomena in a whispering gallery mode resonator. We observed efficient ($\approx 75 %$) polarization conversion of light in a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered optical fiber with proper optimization of the polarization of the propagating light. A simple model treating the microsphere as a ring resonator provides a good fit to the observed behavior.

Limits on WIMP-nucleon interactions with CsI(Tl) crystal detectors - The Korea Invisible Mass Search(KIMS) experiment presents new limits on WIMP-nucleon cross section using the data from an exposure of 3409 kgd taken with low background CsI(Tl) crystals at Yangyang underground laboratory. The most stringent limit on the spin dependent interaction for pure proton case is obtained. The DAMA signal region for both spin independent and spin dependent interactions for the WIMP mass higher than 20 GeV/c^2are excluded by the single experiment with crystal scintillators.

Stopping effects in U+U collisions with a beam energy of 520 MeV/nucleon - A Relativistic Transport Model (ART1.0) is applied to simulate the stopping effects in tip-tip and body-body U+U collisions, at a beam kinetic energy of 520 MeV/nucleon. Our simulation results have demonstrated that both central collisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also form a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and long duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward flow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body ones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body central collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$ in contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the novel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide a good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively. The Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built at Lanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expected to make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state (EoS).

QED for fields obeying a square root operator equation - Instead of using local field equations - like the Dirac equation for spin-1/2 and the Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles - one could try to use non-local field equations in order to describe scattering processes. The latter equations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the correspondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator. By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and taking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling constant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the framework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or for the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the scalar case. These results are then compared with the corresponding ones based on the Klein-Gordon equation. A proposal of how to transfer these reflections to the spin-1/2 case is also presented.

Feedback from first radiation sources: H- photodissociation - During the epoch of reionization, the formation of radiation sources is accompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate the impact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the first galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source. By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H- photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the primordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.

The 3D +-J Ising model at the ferromagnetic transition line - We study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising model [with a random-exchange probability $P(J_{xy}) = p \delta(J_{xy} - J) + (1-p) \delta(J_{xy} + J)$] at the transition line between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phase, which extends from $p=1$ to a multicritical (Nishimori) point at $p=p_N\approx 0.767$. By a finite-size scaling analysis of Monte Carlo simulations at various values of $p$ in the region $p_N<p<1$, we provide strong numerical evidence that the critical behavior along the ferromagnetic transition line belongs to the same universality class as the three-dimensional randomly-dilute Ising model. We obtain the results $\nu=0.682(3)$ and $\eta=0.036(2)$ for the critical exponents, which are consistent with the estimates $\nu=0.683(2)$ and $\eta=0.036(1)$ at the transition of randomly-dilute Ising models.

Star Formation in the Bok Globule CB54 - We present mid-infrared (10.4 \micron, 11.7 \micron, and 18.3 \micron) imaging intended to locate and characterize the suspected protostellar components within the Bok globule CB54. We detect and confirm the protostellar status for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for CB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \approx 8 L_\sun$, and we estimate a central source mass of $M_* \approx 0.8 M_\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of ${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source (CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight. In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the dense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0 protostars.

Quantitative Resolution to some "Absolute Discrepancies" in Cancer Theories: a View from Phage lambda Genetic Switch - Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to understand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature. The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and his colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer accumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering all available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer theory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer theories. They have then listed 9 "absolute discrepancies" for such cancer theory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major reasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a first principle computation, is explicitly pointed out.

Reduced phase space and toric variety coordinatizations of Delzant spaces - In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant space defined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and give explicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point of the torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization of an open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell is equal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations of the Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point), and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of the reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximal coordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about the Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These can be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make the presentation more self-contained.

Fragmentation of general relativistic quasi-toroidal polytropes - We investigate the role of rotational instabilities in the context of black hole formation in relativistic stars. In addition to the standard scenario - an axially symmetric dynamical instability forming a horizon at the star's center - the recently found low-$T/|W|$ instabilities are shown to lead to fragmentation and off-center horizon formation in differentially rotating stars. This process might be an alternative pathway to produce SMBHs from supermassive stars with inefficient angular momentum transport.

A Survey of Huebschmann and Stasheff's Paper: Formal Solution of the Master Equation via HPT and Deformation Theory - These notes, based on the paper "Formal Solution of the Master Equation via HPT and Deformation Theory" by Huebschmann and Stasheff, were prepared for a series of talks at Illinois State University with the intention of applying Homological Perturbation Theory to the derived bracket constructions of Kosmann-Schwarzbach and T. Voronov, and eventually writing Part II of the paper "Higher Derived Brackets and Deformation Theory I" by the present authors.

A variational formulation of electrodynamics with external sources - We present a variational formulation of electrodynamics using de Rham even and odd differential forms. Our formulation relies on a variational principle more complete than the Hamilton principle and thus leads to field equations with external sources and permits the derivation of the constitutive relations. We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits a treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In particular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by using a current with a one point support.

Protein and ionic surfactants - promoters and inhibitors of contact line pinning - We report a new effect of surfactants in pinning a drop contact line, specifically that lysozyme promotes while lauryl sulfate inhibits pinning. We explain the pinning disparity assuming difference in wetting: the protein-laden drop wets a "clean" surface and the surfactant-laden drop wets an auto-precursored surface.

Type D Einstein spacetimes in higher dimensions - We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G, I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic'' type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5, however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with ``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic'' case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.

Eigen Equation of the Nonlinear Spinor - How to effectively solve the eigen solutions of the nonlinear spinor field equation coupling with some other interaction fields is important to understand the behavior of the elementary particles. In this paper, we derive a simplified form of the eigen equation of the nonlinear spinor, and then propose a scheme to solve their numerical solutions. This simplified equation has elegant and neat structure, which is more convenient for both theoretical analysis and numerical computation.

Measurement of B(D_S^+ --> ell^+ nu) and the Decay Constant f_D_{S^+} - We examine e+e- --> Ds- Ds*+ and Ds*- Ds+ interactions at 4170 MeV using the CLEO-c detector in order to measure the decay constant fDs+. We use the Ds+ --> l+ nu channel, where the l+ designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+ --> pi+ nu. Analyzing both modes independently, we determine B(Ds+ --> mu+ nu) = (0.594 +- 0.066 +- 0.031)%, and B(Ds+ --> tau+ nu) = (8.0 +- 1.3 +- 0.4)%. We also analyze them simultaneously to find an effective value of B{eff}(Ds+ --> mu+ nu) = (0.638 +- 0.059 +- 0.033)% and extract fDs = (274 +- 13 +- 7) MeV. Combining with our previous determination of B(D+ -> mu+ nu), we also find the ratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. We compare to current theoretical estimates. Finally, we find B(Ds+ --> e+ nu) < 1.3 x10^{-4} at 90% confidence level.

Broadening the Higgs Boson with Right-Handed Neutrinos and a Higher Dimension Operator at the Electroweak Scale - The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may open up new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed neutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs boson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are subdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic decay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks. A distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced vertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed using the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel decay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental constraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question of whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the approximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.

Coulomb blockade of anyons - Coulomb interaction turns anyonic quasiparticles of a primary quantum Hall liquid with filling factor $\nu =1/(2m+1)$ into hard-core anyons. We have developed a model of coherent transport of such quasiparticles in systems of multiple antidots by extending the Wigner-Jordan description of 1D abelian anyons to tunneling problems. We show that the anyonic exchange statistics manifests itself in tunneling conductance even in the {\em absence} of quasiparticle exchanges. In particular, it can be seen as a non-vanishing resonant peak associated with quasiparticle tunneling through a line of three antidots.

Dynamics of a quantum phase transition in a ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate - We discuss dynamics of a slow quantum phase transition in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We determine analytically the scaling properties of the system magnetization and verify them with numerical simulations in a one dimensional model.

Evidence for a planetary companion around a nearby young star - We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD 70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about 100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3 days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU. The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.

Quantum electromagnetic X-waves - We show that two distinct quantum states of the electromagnetic field can be associated to a classical vector X wave or a propagation-invariant solution of Maxwell equations. The difference between the two states is of pure quantum mechanical origin since they are internally entangled and disentangled, respectively and can be generated by different linear or nonlinear processes. Detection and generation of Schr\"odinger-cat states comprising two entangled X-waves and their possible applications are discussed.

Neutron-neutron scattering length from the reaction gamma d --> pi^+ nn employing chiral perturbation theory - We discuss the possibility to extract the neutron-neutron scattering length a_{nn} from experimental spectra on the reaction gamma d --> pi^+ nn. The transition operator is calculated to high accuracy from chiral perturbation theory. We argue that for properly chosen kinematics, the theoretical uncertainty of the method can be as low as 0.1 fm.

Multiple Unfoldings of Orbifold Singularities: Engineering Geometric Analogies to Unification - Katz and Vafa showed how charged matter can arise geometrically by the deformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, and F-theory compactifications. In this paper we use those same basic ingredients, used there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here to deform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally compliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea explicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand unified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework, the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model fields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex structure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing the arbitrariness of their relative positions.

Geometrically Engineering the Standard Model: Locally Unfolding Three Families out of E8 - This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in which we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform geometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry. This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced. In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically engineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the three families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a single, isolated E8 singularity.

The classification of surfaces with p_g=q=1 isogenous to a product of curves - A projective surface S is said to be isogenous to a product if there exist two smooth curves C, F and a finite group G acting freely on C \times F so that S=(C \times F)/G. In this paper we classify all surfaces with p_g=q=1 which are isogenous to a product.

Manipulating the rotational properties of a two-component Bose gas - A rotating, two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is shown to exhibit vortices of multiple quantization, which are possible due to the interatomic interactions between the two species. Also, persistent currents are absent in this system. Finally, the order parameter has a very simple structure for a range of angular momenta.

Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs - Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these `hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their present orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at which the planet is released to migrate.

Worldsheet Instantons and Torsion Curves, Part B: Mirror Symmetry - We apply mirror symmetry to the problem of counting holomorphic rational curves in a Calabi-Yau threefold X with Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines. As we found in Part A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3 contains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as its covering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X is self-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we derive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In particular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on the torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the threefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of torsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.

Disorder screening near the Mott-Anderson transition - Correlation-driven screening of disorder is studied within the typical-medium dynamical mean-field theory (TMT-DMFT) of the Mott-Anderson transition. In the strongly correlated regime, the site energies epsilon_R^i characterizing the effective disorder potential are strongly renormalized due to the phenomenon of Kondo pinning. This effect produces very strong screening when the interaction U is stronger then disorder W, but applies only to a fraction of the sites in the opposite limit (U<W).

Electromigrated nanoscale gaps for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy - Single-molecule detection with chemical specificity is a powerful and much desired tool for biology, chemistry, physics, and sensing technologies. Surface-enhanced spectroscopies enable single molecule studies, yet reliable substrates of adequate sensitivity are in short supply. We present a simple, scaleable substrate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) incorporating nanometer-scale electromigrated gaps between extended electrodes. Molecules in the nanogap active regions exhibit hallmarks of very high Raman sensitivity, including blinking and spectral diffusion. Electrodynamic simulations show plasmonic focusing, giving electromagnetic enhancements approaching those needed for single-molecule SERS.

Dramatic Variability of X-ray Absorption Lines in the Black Hole Candidate Cygnus X-1 - We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\em Chandra X-ray Observatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum. The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe, some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly, however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\ was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of $0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

Antiferromagnetism-superconductivity competition in electron-doped cuprates triggered by oxygen reduction - We have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of as-grown and oxygen-reduced Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ and Pr$_{1-x}$LaCe$_{x}$CuO$_4$ electron-doped cuprates. In contrast to the common belief, neither the band filling nor the band parameters are significantly affected by the oxygen reduction process. Instead, we show that the main electronic role of the reduction process is to remove an anisotropic leading edge gap around the Fermi surface. While the nodal leading edge gap is induced by long-range antiferomagnetic order, the origin of the antinodal one remains unclear.

An Extrasolar Planet Census with a Space-based Microlensing Survey - A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses and orbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to all the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with short lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and habitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an example of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the NASA Discovery Program cost cap.

USco1606-1935: An Unusually Wide Low-Mass Triple System? - We present photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic observations of USco160611.9-193532 AB, a candidate ultrawide (~1600 AU), low-mass (M_tot~0.4 M_sun) multiple system in the nearby OB association Upper Scorpius. We conclude that both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also present high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a close binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the system would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have unusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass. However, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on probabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation range. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that there is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass association members will be separated in projection by <15", so analysis of the wide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all wide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at the 98% confidence level.

Particle propagation in cosmological backgrounds - We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, by considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding universe, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effects related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.

Quantum analysis of a linear DC SQUID mechanical displacement detector - We provide a quantum analysis of a DC SQUID mechanical displacement detector within the sub-critical Josephson current regime. A segment of the SQUID loop forms the mechanical resonator and motion of the latter is transduced inductively through changes in the flux threading the loop. Expressions are derived for the detector signal response and noise, which are used to evaluate the position and force detection sensitivity. We also investigate cooling of the mechanical resonator due to back reaction noise from the detector.

Rotation Measures of Extragalactic Sources Behind the Southern Galactic Plane: New Insights into the Large-Scale Magnetic Field of the Inner Milky Way - We present new Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 148 extragalactic radio sources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), and use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms. To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm (as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone, in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not required to account for observations.

On iterated image size for point-symmetric relations - Let $\Gamma =(V,E)$ be a point-symmetric reflexive relation and let $v\in V$ such that $|\Gamma (v)|$ is finite (and hence $|\Gamma (x)|$ is finite for all $x$, by the transitive action of the group of automorphisms). Let $j\in \N$ be an integer such that $\Gamma ^j(v)\cap \Gamma ^{-}(v)=\{v\}$. Our main result states that $$ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)|\ge | \Gamma ^{j-1} (v)| + |\Gamma (v)|-1.$$ As an application we have $ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)| \ge 1+(|\Gamma (v)|-1)j.$ The last result confirms a recent conjecture of Seymour in the case of vertex-symmetric graphs. Also it gives a short proof for the validity of the Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture for vertex-symmetric graphs and generalizes an additive result of Shepherdson.

The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT): A Small Robotic Telescope for Large-Area Synoptic Surveys - The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project is a survey for planetary transits of bright stars. It consists of a small-aperture, wide-field automated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The telescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25% of the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag, searching for transits by close-in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware and software and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is able to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary transits around solar-type main sequence stars.

Entanglement increase from local interactions with not-completely-positive maps - Simple examples are constructed that show the entanglement of two qubits being both increased and decreased by interactions on just one of them. One of the two qubits interacts with a third qubit, a control, that is never entangled or correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled, but becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangled qubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to separable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two qubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control; then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control. When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state of the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two independent interactions that individually give exponential decay of the entanglement can cause the entanglement to not decay exponentially but, instead, go to zero at a finite time.

Extended solar emission - an analysis of the EGRET data - The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-ray emission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with the solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse extragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While this emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the situation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed study of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for the effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which interfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon signal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for emission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our model for the extended emission.

Mass and Temperature of the TWA 7 Debris Disk - We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micron around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk around TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses) assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in the TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs. debris) as a function of spectral type.

Annealed importance sampling of dileucine peptide - Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense. Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.

A General Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Equation and its Associated Entropy - A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are discussed.

Conduction electron spin-lattice relaxation time in the MgB2 superconductor - The spin-lattice relaxation time, $T_{1}$, of conduction electrons is measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field in MgB$_2$. The method is based on the detection of the $z$ component of the conduction electron magnetization under electron spin resonance conditions with amplitude modulated microwave excitation. Measurement of $T_{1}$ below $T_c$ at 0.32 T allows to disentangle contributions from the two Fermi surfaces of MgB$_{2}$ as this field restores normal state on the Fermi surface part with $\pi$ symmetry only.

Modeling Accretion Disk X-ray Continuum of Black Hole Candidates - We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the determination of the so-called "color correction factor", which is often empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.

Inapproximability of Maximum Weighted Edge Biclique and Its Applications - Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\it both} positive and negative weights from set $\mathcal{S}$, the {\it maximum weighted edge biclique} problem, or $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find a bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its (in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range of choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max \mathcal{S}} | \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where $\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that: 1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in \cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is $n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \cite{Bu05} unless $\mathsf{RP=NP}$.

On line arrangements with applications to 3-nets - We show a one-to-one correspondence between arrangements of d lines in the projective plane, and lines in P^{d-2}. We apply this correspondence to classify (3,q)-nets over the complex numbers for all q<=6. When q=6, we have twelve possible combinatorial cases, but we prove that only nine of them are realizable. This new case shows several new properties for 3-nets: different dimensions for moduli, strict realization over certain fields, etc. We also construct a three dimensional family of (3,8)-nets corresponding to the Quaternion group.

Testing turbulence model at metric scales with mid-infrared VISIR images at the VLT - We probe turbulence structure from centimetric to metric scales by simultaneous imagery at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths at the VLT telescope and show that it departs significantly from the commonly used Kolmogorov model. The data can be fitted by the von Karman model with an outer scale of the order of 30 m and we see clear signs of the phase structure function saturation across the 8-m VLT aperture. The image quality improves in the infrared faster than the standard lambda^{-1/5} scaling and may be diffraction-limited at 30-m apertures even without adaptive optics at wavelengths longer than 8 micron.

Density dependence of the symmetry energy and the nuclear equation of state: A Dynamical and Statistical model perspective - The density dependence of the symmetry energy in the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is of significant importance for studying the structure of systems as diverse as the neutron-rich nuclei and the neutron stars. A number of reactions using the dynamical and the statistical models of multifragmentation, and the experimental isoscaling observable, is studied to extract information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. It is observed that the dynamical and the statistical model calculations give consistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model to be small. A comparison with several other independent studies is also made to obtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy. The comparison rules out an extremely " stiff " and " soft " form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy with important implications for astrophysical and nuclear physics studies.

Competitive nucleation and the Ostwald rule in a generalized Potts model with multiple metastable phases - We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastable phases, the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by the parameters of the system. With this model we can construct, for example, a system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable phases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases accessible from it.

Contrasting Two Transformation-Based Methods for Obtaining Absolute Extrema - In this note we contrast two transformation-based methods to deduce absolute extrema and the corresponding extremizers. Unlike variation-based methods, the transformation-based ones of Carlson and Leitmann and the recent one of Silva and Torres are direct in that they permit obtaining solutions by inspection.

Application of Ewald summations to long-range dispersion forces - We present results illustrating the effects of using explicit summation terms for the $r^{-6}$ dispersion term on the interfacial properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid and SPC/E water. For the Lennard-Jones fluid, we find that the use of long-range summations, even with a short ``crossover radius,'' yields results that are consistent with simulations using large cutoff radii. Simulations of SPC/E water demonstrate that the long-range dispersion forces are of secondary importance to the Coulombic forces. In both cases, we find that the ratio of box size $L_{\parallel}$ to crossover radius $r_{\rm c}^{\mathbf k}$ plays an important role in determining the magnitude of the long-range dispersion correction, although its effect is secondary when Coulombic interactions are also present.

Possible non-thermal nature of the soft-excess emission in the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03 - We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newton of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess emission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft excess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton observations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the position of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with models of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed properties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal interpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated with the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying population might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.

Geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency potential - We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and a time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabatically evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the atomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field, including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing adiabatic rf potentials.

The Transition from the First Stars to the Second Stars in the Early Universe - We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode of star formation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at a metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including the radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic simulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars, led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5 Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4 Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >= 10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.

Super Star Cluster Velocity Dispersions and Virial Masses in the M82 Nuclear Starburst - We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck Observatory to measure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19 super star clusters (SSCs) in the nuclear starburst of M82. The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr, which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity dispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6 solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses. Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular clusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs are a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function for the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06. This result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the Antennae galaxies.

The affine part of the Picard scheme - We describe the maximal torus and maximal unipotent subgroup of the Picard variety of a proper scheme over a perfect field.

Enhanced quantum Zeno effect and bunching in the decay of interacting bosons from an unstable state - paper withdrawn due to the possible error in numerical eigenfunction calculation

The few scales of nuclei and nuclear matter - The well-known correlations of low-energy three and four-nucleon observables with a typical three-nucleon scale (e.g., the Tjon line) is extended to light nuclei and nuclear matter. Evidence for the scaling between light nuclei binding energies and the triton one are pointed out. We argue that the saturation energy and density of nuclear matter are correlated to the triton binding energy. The available systematic nuclear matter calculations indicate a possible band structure representing these correlations.

Implementation of holonomic quantum computation through engineering and manipulating environment - We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-level atoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distant cavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that an effective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions. Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in the two cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating the engineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineering environment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computation together has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shift is implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of the driving fields.

Vortex state in a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor based on the quasiclassical theory - We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The \pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.

Search for Chaotic Behavior in a Flapping Flag - We measured the correlation of the times between successive flaps of a flag for a variety of wind speeds and found no evidence of low dimensional chaotic behavior in the return maps of these times. We instead observed what is best modeled as random times determined by an exponential distribution. This study was done as an undergraduate experiment and illustrates the differences between low dimensional chaotic and possibly higher dimensional chaotic systems.

Optimal Shape Design for Stokes Flow Via Minimax Differentiability - This paper is concerned with a shape sensitivity analysis of a viscous incompressible fluid driven by Stokes equations with nonhomogeneous boundary condition. The structure of shape gradient with respect to the shape of the variable domain for a given cost function is established by using the differentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrangian functional combining with function space parametrization technique or function space embedding technique. We apply an gradient type algorithm to our problem. Numerical examples show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and the proposed algorithm is feasible.

Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended Horizontal-Branch - About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass. The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity. Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.

Scalar potential model progress - Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistent with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a Scalar Potential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. The SPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow of IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift without an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data without dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central velocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a model of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the universe. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of the Sources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as between clusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distance to a Source.

Teleparallel Version of the Stationary Axisymmetric Solutions and their Energy Contents - This work contains the teleparallel version of the stationary axisymmetric solutions. We obtain the tetrad and the torsion fields representing these solutions. The tensor, vector and axial-vector parts of the torsion tensor are evaluated. It is found that the axial-vector has component only along $\rho$ and $z$ directions. The three possibilities of the axial vector depending on the metric function $B$ are discussed. The vector related with spin has also been evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further, we use the teleparallel version of M$\ddot{o}$ller prescription to find the energy-momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that (for $\lambda=1$) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory are equal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity in each, which may become equal under certain conditions. Finally, we discuss the two special cases of the stationary axisymmetric solutions.

Relativistic treatment in D-dimensions to a spin-zero particle with noncentral equal scalar and vector ring-shaped Kratzer potential - The Klein-Gordon equation in D-dimensions for a recently proposed Kratzer potential plus ring-shaped potential is solved analytically by means of the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The exact energy bound-states and the corresponding wave functions of the Klein-Gordon are obtained in the presence of the noncentral equal scalar and vector potentials. The results obtained in this work are more general and can be reduced to the standard forms in three-dimensions given by other works.

Long Distance Signaling Using Axion-like Particles - The possible existence of axion-like particles could lead to a new type of long distance communication. In this work, basic antenna concepts are defined and a Friis-like equation is derived to facilitate long-distance link calculations. An example calculation is presented showing that communication over distances of 1000 km or more may be possible for $m_{a}< 3.5$ meV and $g_{a\gamma \gamma} > 5 \times 10^{- 8} {\text{GeV}}^{- 1}$.

Weighted percolation on directed networks - We present an analysis of the percolation transition for general node removal strategies valid for locally tree-like directed networks. On the basis of heuristic arguments we predict that, if the probability of removing node $i$ is $p_i$, the network disintegrates if $p_i$ is such that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with entries $A_{ij}(1-p_i)$ is less than 1, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the network. The knowledge or applicability of a Markov network model is not required by our theory, thus making it applicable to situations not covered by previous works. We test our predicted percolation criterion against numerical results for different networks and node removal strategies.

Refuting the Pseudo Attack on the REESSE1+ Cryptosystem - We illustrate through example 1 and 2 that the condition at theorem 1 in [8] dissatisfies necessity, and the converse proposition of fact 1.1 in [8] does not hold, namely the condition Z/M - L/Ak < 1/(2 Ak^2) is not sufficient for f(i) + f(j) = f(k). Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a logic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4 to be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of qu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) + f(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4 and alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further, manifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is falsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To the signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1 and Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H. Therefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which connotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in REESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly selected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.

Phase structure of a surface model on dynamically triangulated spheres with elastic skeletons - We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations. The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

Vortex Dynamics at the Initial Stage of Resistive Transition in Superconductors with Fractal Cluster Structure - The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in a percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and their features are studied.

The Veldkamp Space of Two-Qubits - Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two, W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2). An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the "classical" subsets answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2).

Fusion process studied with preequilibrium giant dipole resonance in time dependent Hartree-Fock theory - The equilibration of macroscopic degrees of freedom during the fusion of heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.

Penalization approach for mixed hyperbolic systems with constant coefficients satisfying a Uniform Lopatinski Condition - In this paper, we describe a new, systematic and explicit way of approximating solutions of mixed hyperbolic systems with constant coefficients satisfying a Uniform Lopatinski Condition via different Penalization approaches.

A unified analysis of the reactor neutrino program towards the measurement of the theta_13 mixing angle - We present in this article a detailed quantitative discussion of the measurement of the leptonic mixing angle theta_13 through currently scheduled reactor neutrino oscillation experiments. We thus focus on Double Chooz (Phase I & II), Daya Bay (Phase I & II) and RENO experiments. We perform a unified analysis, including systematics, backgrounds and accurate experimental setup in each case. Each identified systematic error and background impact has been assessed on experimental setups following published data when available and extrapolating from Double Chooz acquired knowledge otherwise. After reviewing the experiments, we present a new analysis of their sensitivities to sin^2(2 theta_13) and study the impact of the different systematics based on the pulls approach. Through this generic statistical analysis we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each experimental setup.

Optimal Routing for Decode-and-Forward based Cooperation in Wireless Networks - We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of the strategies on different routes.

On the polynomial automorphisms of a group - We prove that if a group is nilpotent (resp. metabelian), then so is the subgroup of its automorphism group generated by all polynomial automorphisms.

On universality of critical behaviour in the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, elliptic umbilic catastrophe and the {\it tritronqu\'ee} solution to the Painlev\'e-I equation - We argue that the critical behaviour near the point of ``gradient catastrophe" of the solution to the Cauchy problem for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $ i\epsilon \psi_t +\frac{\epsilon^2}2\psi_{xx}+ |\psi|^2 \psi =0$ with analytic initial data of the form $\psi(x,0;\epsilon) =A(x) e^{\frac{i}{\epsilon} S(x)}$ is approximately described by a particular solution to the Painlev\'e-I equation.

Generic representations of orthogonal groups: projective functors in the category Fquad - In this paper, we continue the study of the category of functors Fquad, associated to F_2-vector spaces equipped with a nondegenerate quadratic form, initiated in two previous papers of the author. We define a filtration of the standard projective objects in Fquad; this refines to give a decomposition into indecomposable factors of the two first standard projective objects in Fquad. As an application of these two decompositions, we give a complete description of the polynomial functors of the category Fquad.

Manifolds admitting a $\tilde G_2$-structure - We find a necessary and sufficient condition for a compact 7-manifold to admit a $\tilde G_2$-structure. As a result we find a sufficient condition for an open 7-manifold to admit a closed 3-form of $\tilde G_2$-type.

Compatibility of Exotic States with Neutron Star Observation - We consider the effect of hard core repulsion in the baryon-baryon interaction at short distance to the properties of a neutron star. We obtain that, even with hyperons in the interior of a neutron star, the neutron star mass can be as large as $\sim 2 M_\odot$.

Exact Solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory with Higher-Derivative Coupling - We construct a classical solution of an Einstein-Yang-Mills system with a fourth order term with respect to the field strength of the Yang-Mills field. The solution provides a spontaneous compactification proposed by Cremmer and Scherk; ten-dimensional space-time with a cosmological constant is compactified to the four-dimensional Minkowski space with a six-dimensional sphere S^6 on which an instanton solution exists. The radius of the sphere is not a modulus but is determined by the gauge coupling and the four-derivative coupling constants and the Newton's constant. We also construct a solution of ten-dimensional theory without a cosmological constant compactified to AdS_4 x S^6.

Dimensional crossover of quantum critical behavior in CeCoIn$_5$ - The nature of quantum criticality in CeCoIn$_5$ is studied by low-temperature thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$. At the field-induced quantum critical point at H=5 T a crossover scale $T^\star\approx 0.3$ K is observed, separating $\alpha(T)/T\propto T^{-1}$ from a weaker $T^{-1/2}$ divergence. We ascribe this change to a crossover in the dimensionality of the critical fluctuations which may be coupled to a change from unconventional to conventional quantum criticality. Disorder, whose effect on quantum criticality is studied in CeCoIn$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ ($0\leq x\leq 0.18$), shifts $T^\star$ towards higher temperatures.

E_6 and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits - Recent investigations have established an analogy between the entropy of four-dimensional supersymmetric black holes in string theory and entanglement in quantum information theory. Examples include: (1) N=2 STU black holes and the tripartite entanglement of three qubits (2-state systems), where the common symmetry is [SL(2)]^3 and (2) N=8 black holes and the tripartite entanglement of seven qubits where the common symmetry is E_7 which contains [SL(2)]^7. Here we present another example: N=8 black holes (or black strings) in five dimensions and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits (3-state systems), where the common symmetry is E_6 which contains [SL(3)]^3. Both the black hole (or black string) entropy and the entanglement measure are provided by the Cartan cubic E_6 invariant. Similar analogies exist for ``magic'' N=2 supergravity black holes in both four and five dimensions.

Invariance principle for additive functionals of Markov chains - We consider a sequence of additive functionals {\phi_n}, set on a sequence of Markov chains {X_n} that weakly converges to a Markov process X. We give sufficient condition for such a sequence to converge in distribution, formulated in terms of the characteristics of the additive functionals, and related to the Dynkin's theorem on the convergence of W-functionals. As an application of the main theorem, the general sufficient condition for convergence of additive functionals in terms of transition probabilities of the chains X_n is proved.

Dissipative backward stochastic differential equations with locally Lipschitz nonlinearity - In this paper we study a class of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) of the form dY(t)= -AY(t)dt -f_0(t,Y(t))dt -f_1(t,Y(t),Z(t))dt + Z(t)dW(t) on the interval [0,T], with given final condition at time T, in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H. The unbounded operator A is sectorial and dissipative and the nonlinearity f_0(t,y) is dissipative and defined for y only taking values in a subspace of H. A typical example is provided by the so-called polynomial nonlinearities. Applications are given to stochastic partial differential equations and spin systems.

Axino warm dark matter and $\Omega_b - \Omega_{DM}$ coincidence - We show that axinos, which are dominantly generated by the decay of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles produced from the leptonic $Q$-ball ($L$-ball), become warm dark matter suitable for the solution of the missing satellite problem and the cusp problem. In addition, $\Omega_b - \Omega_{DM}$ coincidence is naturally explained in this scenario.

A unified approach to SIC-POVMs and MUBs - A unified approach to (symmetric informationally complete) positive operator valued measures and mutually unbiased bases is developed in this article. The approach is based on the use of operator equivalents expanded in the enveloping algebra of SU(2). Emphasis is put on similarities and differences between SIC-POVMs and MUBs.

Stable oscillations of a predator-prey probabilistic cellular automaton: a mean-field approach - We analyze a probabilistic cellular automaton describing the dynamics of coexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and the evolution of intermediate polars - Intermediate polars (IPs) are cataclysmic variables which contain magnetic white dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period. Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through the 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs, which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

Complexity Considerations, cSAT Lower Bound - This article discusses completeness of Boolean Algebra as First Order Theory in Goedel's meaning. If Theory is complete then any possible transformation is equivalent to some transformation using axioms, predicates etc. defined for this theory. If formula is to be proved (or disproved) then it has to be reduced to axioms. If every transformation is deducible then also optimal transformation is deducible. If every transformation is exponential then optimal one is too, what allows to define lower bound for discussed problem to be exponential (outside P). Then we show algorithm for NDTM solving the same problem in O(n^c) (so problem is in NP), what proves that P \neq NP. Article proves also that result of relativisation of P=NP question and oracle shown by Baker-Gill-Solovay distinguish between deterministic and non-deterministic calculation models. If there exists oracle A for which P^A=NP^A then A consists of infinite number of algorithms, DTMs, axioms and predicates, or like NDTM infinite number of simultaneous states.

Temperature dependence of Coulomb drag between finite-length quantum wires - We evaluate the Coulomb drag current in two finite-length Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid wires coupled by an electrostatic backscattering interaction. The drag current in one wire shows oscillations as a function of the bias voltage applied to the other wire, reflecting interferences of the plasmon standing waves in the interacting wires. In agreement with this picture, the amplitude of the current oscillations is reduced with increasing temperature. This is a clear signature of non-Fermi-liquid physics because for coupled Fermi liquids the drag resistance is always expected to increase as the temperature is raised.

Effects of Imperfect Gate Operations in Shor's Prime Factorization Algorithm - The effects of imperfect gate operations in implementation of Shor's prime factorization algorithm are investigated. The gate imperfections may be classified into three categories: the systematic error, the random error, and the one with combined errors. It is found that Shor's algorithm is robust against the systematic errors but is vulnerable to the random errors. Error threshold is given to the algorithm for a given number $N$ to be factorized.

Using decomposed household food acquisitions as inputs of a Kinetic Dietary Exposure Model - Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and long term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the SECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the presence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.

Dust and gas emission in the prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 at sub-arcsecond resolution - Aiming at a better understand of the physical and chemical processes in the hot molecular core stage of high-mass star formation, we observed the prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar densities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative causes of this velocity pattern.

Hamilton-Jacobi Fractional Sequential Mechanics - As a continuation of Rabei et al. work [11], the Hamilton- Jacobi partial differential equation is generalized to be applicable for systems containing fractional derivatives. The Hamilton- Jacobi function in configuration space is obtained in a similar manner to the usual mechanics. Two problems are considered to demonstrate the application of the formalism. The result found to be in exact agreement with Agrawal's formalism.

A critical theory of quantum entanglement for the Hydrogen molecule - In this paper we investigate some entanglement properties for the Hydrogen molecule considered as a two interacting spin 1/2 (qubit) model. The entanglement related to the $H_{2}$ molecule is evaluated both using the von Neumann entropy and the Concurrence and it is compared with the corresponding quantities for the two interacting spin system. Many aspects of these functions are examinated employing in part analytical and, essentially, numerical techniques. We have compared analogous results obtained by Huang and Kais a few years ago. In this respect, some possible controversial situations are presented and discussed.

Fractionally charged excitations on frustrated lattices - Systems of strongly correlated fermions on certain geometrically frustrated lattices at particular filling factors support excitations with fractional charges $\pm e/2$. We calculate quantum mechanical ground states, low--lying excitations and spectral functions of finite lattices by means of numerical diagonalization. The ground state of the most thoroughfully studied case, the criss-crossed checkerboard lattice, is degenerate and shows long--range order. Static fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably leading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, the quasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of the fractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, we fine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are manifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeper understanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numerical advantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.

Measurement of Decay Amplitudes of B -->(c cbar) Kstar with an Angular Analysis, for (c cbar)=J/psi, psi(2S) and chi_c1 - We perform the first three-dimensional measurement of the amplitudes of $B\to \psi(2S) K^*$ and $B\to \chi_{c1} K^*$ decays and update our previous measurement for $B\to J/\psi K^*$. We use a data sample collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP2 storage ring, corresponding to 232 million $B\bar B$ pairs. The longitudinal polarization of decays involving a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $\chi_{c1}$ meson is found to be larger than that with a $1^{--}$ $J/\psi$ or $\psi(2S)$ meson. No direct {\it CP}-violating charge asymmetry is observed.

Quantum superpositions and entanglement of thermal states at high temperatures and their applications to quantum information processing - We study characteristics of superpositions and entanglement of thermal states at high temperatures and discuss their applications to quantum information processing. We introduce thermal-state qubits and thermal-Bell states, which are a generalization of pure-state qubits and Bell states to thermal mixtures. A scheme is then presented to discriminate between the four thermal-Bell states without photon number resolving detection but with Kerr nonlinear interactions and two single-photon detectors. This enables one to perform quantum teleportation and gate operations for quantum computation with thermal-state qubits.

Optimal control of stochastic differential equations with dynamical boundary conditions - In this paper we investigate the optimal control problem for a class of stochastic Cauchy evolution problem with non standard boundary dynamic and control. The model is composed by an infinite dimensional dynamical system coupled with a finite dimensional dynamics, which describes the boundary conditions of the internal system. In other terms, we are concerned with non standard boundary conditions, as the value at the boundary is governed by a different stochastic differential equation.

On the Energy-Momentum Problem in Static Einstein Universe - This paper has been removed by arXiv administrators because it plagiarizes gr-qc/0410004, gr-qc/0603075, and others. This paper also has excessive overlap with the following papers also written by the authors or their collaborators: gr-qc/0608111, and others.

Fractional WKB Approximation - Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin (WKB) approximation for fractional systems is investigated in this paper using the fractional calculus. In the fractional case the wave function is constructed such that the phase factor is the same as the Hamilton's principle function "S". To demonstrate our proposed approach two examples are investigated in details.

Towards Skyrmion Stars: Large Baryon Configurations in the Einstein-Skyrme Model - We investigate the large baryon number sector of the Einstein-Skyrme model as a possible model for baryon stars. Gravitating hedgehog skyrmions have been investigated previously and the existence of stable solitonic stars excluded due to energy considerations. However, in this paper we demonstrate that by generating gravitating skyrmions using rational maps, we can achieve multi-baryon bound states whilst recovering spherical symmetry in the limit where B becomes large.

Many-to-One Throughput Capacity of IEEE 802.11 Multi-hop Wireless Networks - This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry, one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of "canonical networks", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink; and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy in the Superconducting State and Vortex Cores of the beta-pyrochlore KOs2O6 - We performed the first scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor KOs2O6 (Tc = 9.6 K) in both zero magnetic field and the vortex state at several temperatures above 1.95 K. This material presents atomically flat surfaces, yielding spatially homogeneous spectra which reveal fully-gapped superconductivity with a gap anisotropy of 30%. Measurements performed at fields of 2 and 6 T display a hexagonal Abrikosov flux line lattice. From the shape of the vortex cores, we extract a coherence length of 31-40 {\AA}, in agreement with the value derived from the upper critical field Hc2. We observe a reduction in size of the vortex cores (and hence the coherence length) with increasing field which is consistent with the unexpectedly high and unsaturated upper critical field reported.

Noncommutative Solitons in a Supersymmetric Chiral Model in 2+1 Dimensions - We consider a supersymmetric Bogomolny-type model in 2+1 dimensions originating from twistor string theory. By a gauge fixing this model is reduced to a modified U(n) chiral model with N<=8 supersymmetries in 2+1 dimensions. After a Moyal-type deformation of the model, we employ the dressing method to explicitly construct multi-soliton configurations on noncommutative R^{2,1} and analyze some of their properties.

Gravitational Duality Transformations on (A)dS4 - We discuss the implementation of electric-magnetic duality transformations in four-dimensional gravity linearized around Minkowski or (A)dS4 backgrounds. In the presence of a cosmological constant duality generically modifies the Hamiltonian, nevertheless the bulk dynamics is unchanged. We pay particular attention to the boundary terms generated by the duality transformations and discuss their implications for holography.

Effect of transition-metal elements on the electronic properties of quasicrystals and complex aluminides - In this paper, we briefly present our work on the role of transition-metal element in electronic structure and transport properties of quasicrystals and related complex phases. Several Parts of these works have been done or initiated in collaboration with Prof. T. Fujiwara.

Non-resonant and Resonant X-ray Scattering Studies on Multiferroic TbMn2O5 - Comprehensive x-ray scattering studies, including resonant scattering at Mn L-edge, Tb L- and M-edges, were performed on single crystals of TbMn2O5. X-ray intensities were observed at a forbidden Bragg position in the ferroelectric phases, in addition to the lattice and the magnetic modulation peaks. Temperature dependences of their intensities and the relation between the modulation wave vectors provide direct evidences of exchange striction induced ferroelectricity. Resonant x-ray scattering results demonstrate the presence of multiple magnetic orders by exhibiting their different temperature dependences. The commensurate-to-incommensurate phase transition around 24 K is attributed to discommensuration through phase slipping of the magnetic orders in spin frustrated geometries. We proposed that the low temperature incommensurate phase consists of the commensurate magnetic domains separated by anti-phase domain walls which reduce spontaneous polarizations abruptly at the transition.

Self-diffusion and Interdiffusion in Al80Ni20 Melts: Simulation and Experiment - A combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts. Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the long-capillary (LC) method and by quasielastic neutron scattering. The LC method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under consideration.

The Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in Massive Elliptical Galaxies: Globular Cluster Multimodality from Radial Variation of Stellar Populations - The most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi-modality in their globular cluster system color distributions. Understanding the mechanisms which lead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete picture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster formation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial variations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino & Matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the distribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric radius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular clusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the observed multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar populations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population of globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very good agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity distribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of merger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity transformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model (abridged)

Binaries, microquasars and GLAST - Radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic jets of microquasars show evidence for the acceleration of particles to very high energies. Signatures of non-thermal processes occurring closer in to the compact object can also be found. In addition, three binaries are now established emitters of high (> 100 MeV) and/or very high (> 100GeV) energy gamma-rays. High-energy emission can originate from a microquasar jet (accretion-powered) or from a shocked pulsar wind (rotation-powered). I discuss the impact GLAST will have in the very near future on studies of such binaries. GLAST is expected to shed new light on the link between accretion and ejection in microquasars and to enable to probe pulsar winds on small scales in rotation-powered binaries.

Linearisation of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane - This article gives the proof of results announced in [J. Blanc, Finite Abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, S\'er. I 344 (2007), 21-26.] and some description of automorphisms of rational surfaces. Given a finite Abelian subgroup of the Cremona group of the plane, we provide a way to decide whether it is birationally conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal surface. In particular, we prove that a finite cyclic group of birational transformations of the plane is linearisable if and only if none of its non-trivial elements fix a curve of positive genus. For finite Abelian groups, there exists only one surprising exception, a group isomorphic to Z/2ZxZ/4Z, whose non-trivial elements do not fix a curve of positive genus but which is not conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal rational surface. We also give some descriptions of automorphisms (not necessarily of finite order) of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles.

Oriented growth of pentacene films on vacuum-deposited polytetrafluoroethylene layers aligned by rubbing technique - We investigated structure and morphology of PTFE layers deposited by vacuum process in dependence on deposition parameters: deposition rate, deposition temperature, electron activation energy and activation current. Pentacene (PnC) layers deposited on top of those PTFE films are used as a tool to demonstrate the orienting ability of the PTFE layers. The molecular structure of the PTFE films was investigated by use of infrared spectroscopy. By means of ellipsometry, values of refractive index between 1.33 and 1.36 have been obtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the cold friction technique orienting PTFE layers with unidirectional grooves are obtained. On top of these PTFE films oriented PnC layers were grown. The obtained order depends both on the PTFE layer thickness and on PnC growth temperature.

Integral representations for convolutions of non-central multivariate gamma distributions - Three types of integral representations for the cumulative distribution functions of convolutions of non-central p-variate gamma distributions are given by integration of elementary complex functions over the p-cube Cp = (-pi,pi]x...x(-pi,pi]. In particular, the joint distribution of the diagonal elements of a generalized quadratic form XAX' with n independent normally distributed column vectors in X is obtained. For a single p-variate gamma distribution function (p-1)-variate integrals over Cp-1 are derived. The integrals are numerically more favourable than integrals obtained from the Fourier or laplace inversion formula.

On the Achievable Rate Regions for Interference Channels with Degraded Message Sets - The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding, is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme, achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer considerable improvements over these existing results.

On complete subsets of the cyclic group - A subset $X$ of an abelian $G$ is said to be {\em complete} if every element of the subgroup generated by $X$ can be expressed as a nonempty sum of distinct elements from $X$. Let $A\subset \Z_n$ be such that all the elements of $A$ are coprime with $n$. Solving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Heilbronn, Olson proved that $A$ is complete if $n$ is a prime and if $|A|>2\sqrt{n}.$ Recently Vu proved that there is an absolute constant $c$, such that for an arbitrary large $n$, $A$ is complete if $|A|\ge c\sqrt{n},$ and conjectured that 2 is essentially the right value of $c$. We show that $A$ is complete if $|A|> 1+2\sqrt{n-4}$, thus proving the last conjecture.

Hilbert functions of points on Schubert varieties in Orthogonal Grassmannians - A solution is given to the following problem: how to compute the multiplicity, or more generally the Hilbert function, at a point on a Schubert variety in an orthogonal Grassmannian. Standard monomial theory is applied to translate the problem from geometry to combinatorics. The solution of the resulting combinatorial problem forms the bulk of the paper. This approach has been followed earlier to solve the same problem for the Grassmannian and the symplectic Grassmannian. As an application, we present an interpretation of the multiplicity as the number of non-intersecting lattice paths of a certain kind. Taking the Schubert variety to be of a special kind and the point to be the "identity coset," our problem specializes to a problem about Pfaffian ideals treatments of which by different methods exist in the literature. Also available in the literature is a geometric solution when the point is a "generic singularity."

Swift/XRT observes the fifth outburst of the periodic Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient IGR J11215-5952 - IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005 with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of ~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards, during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage, and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous accretion.

Crossover behavior in fluids with Coulomb interactions - According to extensive experimental findings, the Ginzburg temperature $t_{G}$ for ionic fluids differs substantially from that of nonionic fluids [Schr\"oer W., Weig\"{a}rtner H. 2004 {\it Pure Appl. Chem.} {\bf 76} 19]. A theoretical investigation of this outcome is proposed here by a mean field analysis of the interplay of short and long range interactions on the value of $t_{G}$. We consider a quite general continuous charge-asymmetric model made of charged hard spheres with additional short-range interactions (without electrostatic interactions the model belongs to the same universality class as the 3D Ising model). The effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian of the full system near its gas-liquid critical point is derived from which the Ginzburg temperature is calculated as a function of the ionicity. The results obtained in this way for $t_{G}$ are in good qualitative and sufficient quantitative agreement with available experimental data.

Reply to Comment of Kenzelmann and Harris - In response to the comment of Kenzelmann and Harris I show how the continuum theory of spiral multiferroics can be modified to describe general magnetic orders and discuss why the microscopic mechanism of magnetically-induced ferroelectricity usually makes such modifications unnecessary. This explains why the simple model with a single vector order parameter successfully describes thermodynamics and magnetoelectric properties of many spiral multiferroics.

Persistent Currents in Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices - Starting from the reduced dynamical model of a two-junction quantum interference device, a quantum analog of the system has been exhibited, in order to extend the well known properties of this device to the quantum regime. By finding eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian operator, the persistent currents flowing in the ring have been obtained. The resulting quantum analog of the overdamped two-junction quantum interference device can be seen as a supercurrent qubit operating in the limit of negligible capacitance and finite inductance.

Mid-Infrared Fine Structure Line Ratios in Active Galactic Nuclei Observed with Spitzer IRS: Evidence for Extinction by the Torus - We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and [SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed [NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby galaxies.

Neutrinos and Non-proliferation in Europe - Triggered by the demand of the IAEA, neutrino physicists in Europe involved with the Double Chooz experiment are studying the potential of neutrino detection to monitor nuclear reactors. In particular a new set of experiments at the ILL is planned to improve the knowledge of the neutrino spectrum emitted in the fission of 235U and 239Pu.

Kinks and Particles in Non-integrable Quantum Field Theories - In this talk we discuss an elementary derivation of the semi-classical spectrum of neutral particles in two field theories with kink excitations. We also show that, in the non-integrable cases, each vacuum state cannot generically support more than two stable particles, since all other neutral exitations are resonances, which will eventually decay.

The old open clusters Berkeley 32 and King 11 - We have obtained CCD BVI imaging of the old open clusters Berkeley 32 and King 11. Using the synthetic colour-magnitude diagram method with three different sets of stellar evolution models of various metallicities, with and without overshooting, we have determined their age, distance, reddening, and indicative metallicity, as well as distance from the Galactic centre and height from the Galactic plane. The best parameters derived for Berkeley 32 are: subsolar metallicity (Z=0.008 represents the best choice, Z=0.006 or 0.01 are more marginally acceptable), age = 5.0-5.5 Gyr (models with overshooting; without overshooting the age is 4.2-4.4 Gyr with poorer agreement), (m-M)_0=12.4-12.6, E(B-V)=0.12-0.18 (with the lower value being more probable because it corresponds to the best metallicity), Rgc ~ 10.7-11 kpc, and |Z| ~ 231-254 pc. The best parameters for King 11 are: Z=0.01, age=3.5-4.75 Gyr, (m-M)_0=11.67-11.75, E(B-V)=1.03-1.06, Rgc ~ 9.2-10 kpc, and |Z| ~ 253-387 pc.

The Genetic Programming Collaboration Network and its Communities - Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central network component and a high clustering.

The Expanding Photosphere Method: Progress and Problems - Distances to well-observed Type II-P SNe are determined from an updated version of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM), based on recent theoretical models. The new EPM distances show good agreement with other independent distances to the host galaxies without any significant systematic bias, contrary to earlier results in the literature. The accuracy of the method is comparable with that of the distance measurements for Type Ia SNe.

Spontaneous Lorentz Violation: Non-Abelian Gauge Fields as Pseudo-Goldstone Vector Bosons - We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu }\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry $SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered. However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity. For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could become directly observable at low energies.

In-medium effects on particle production in heavy ion collisions - The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions ($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and $(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios, since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its isovector sector.

The Graham conjecture implies the Erdos-Turan conjecture - Erd\"{o}s and Tur\'{a}n once conjectured that any set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ with $\sum_{a\in A}{1}/{a}=\infty$ should contain infinitely many progressions of arbitrary length $k\geq3$. For the two-dimensional case Graham conjectured that if $B\subset \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $$\sum\limits_{(x,y)\in B}\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}=\infty,$$ then for any $s\geq2$, $B$ contains an $s\times s$ axes-parallel grid. In this paper it is shown that if the Graham conjecture is true for some $s\geq2$, then the Erd\"{o}s-Tur\'{a}n conjecture is true for $k=2s-1$.

Effective conservation of energy and momentum algorithm using switching potentials suitable for molecular dynamics simulation of thermodynamical systems - During a crossover via a switching mechanism from one 2-body potential to another as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of bond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which determines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potential interactions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This problem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the system for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both energy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the algorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD simulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within experimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box should also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities. It is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.

Mixed chemistry phenomenon during late stages of stellar evolution - We discuss phenomenon of simultaneous presence of O- and C-based material in surroundings of evolutionary advanced stars. We concentrate on silicate carbon stars and present observations that directly confirm the binary model scenario for them. We discuss also class of C-stars with OH emission detected, to which some [WR] planetary nebulae do belong.

M-regularity of the Fano surface - Let $(A,\Theta)$ be a principally polarised abelian variety, and let Y be a subvariety. Pareschi and Popa conjectured that Y has minimal cohomology class if and only if the structure sheaf of Y satisfies a property that they call M-regularity. Let now X be a smooth cubic threefold. By a classical result due to Clemens and Griffiths, its intermediate Jacobian J(X) is a principally polarised abelian variety; furthermore the Fano surface of lines on X can be embedded in J(X) and has minimal cohomology class. In this short note we show that its structure sheaf is M-regular.

Signal for space-time noncommutativity: the Z -> gamma gamma decay in the renormalizable gauge sector of the theta-expanded NCSM - We propose the Z -> gamma gamma decay, a process strictly forbidden in the standard model, as a signal suitable for the search of noncommutativity of coordinates at very short distances. We compute the Z -> gamma gamma partial widthin the framework of the recently proposed renormalizable gauge sector of the noncommutative standard model. The one-loop renormalizability is obtained for the model containing the usual six representations of matter fields of the first generation. Even more, the noncommutative part is finite or free of divergences, showing that perhaps new interaction symmetry exists in the noncommutative gauge sector of the model. Discovery of such symmetry would be of tremendous importance in further search for the violation of the Lorentz invariance at very high energies. Experimental possibilities of Z -> gamma gamma decay are analyzed and a firm bound to the scale of the noncommutativity parameter is set around 1 TeV.

Laser spectroscopy of hyperfine structure in highly-charged ions: a test of QED at high fields - An overview is presented of laser spectroscopy experiments with cold, trapped, highly-charged ions, which will be performed at the HITRAP facility at GSI in Darmstadt (Germany). These high-resolution measurements of ground state hyperfine splittings will be three orders of magnitude more precise than previous measurements. Moreover, from a comparison of measurements of the hyperfine splittings in hydrogen- and lithium-like ions of the same isotope, QED effects at high electromagnetic fields can be determined within a few percent. Several candidate ions suited for these laser spectroscopy studies are presented.

Confinement into a state with persistent current by thermal quenching of loop of Josephson junctions - We study a loop of Josephson junctions that is quenched through its critical temperature. For three or more junctions, symmetry breaking states can be achieved without thermal activation, in spite of the fact that the relaxation time is practically constant when the critical temperature is approached from above. The probability for these states decreases with quenching time, but the dependence is not allometric. For large number of junctions, cooling does not have to be fast. For this case, we evaluate the standard deviation of the induced flux. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data.

Frequency modulation Fourier transform spectroscopy - A new method, FM-FTS, combining Frequency Modulation heterodyne laser spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Spectroscopy is presented. It provides simultaneous sensitive measurement of absorption and dispersion profiles with broadband spectral coverage capabilities. Experimental demonstration is made on the overtone spectrum of C2H2 in the 1.5 $\mu$m region.

Universe Without Singularities. A Group Approach to De Sitter Cosmology - In the last years the traditional scenario of Big Bang has been deeply modified by the study of the quantum features of the Universe evolution, proposing again the problem of using local physical laws on cosmic scale, with particular regard to the cosmological constant role. The group extention method shows that the De Sitter group univocally generalizes the Poincare group, formally justifies the cosmological constant use and suggests a new interpretation for Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions in Quantum Cosmology.

Spectral action on noncommutative torus - The spectral action on noncommutative torus is obtained, using a Chamseddine--Connes formula via computations of zeta functions. The importance of a Diophantine condition is outlined. Several results on holomorphic continuation of series of holomorphic functions are obtained in this context.

The Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation for reaction-controlled kinetics - We rigorously derive a weak form of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation as the homogenization limit of a Stefan-type problem describing reaction-controlled coarsening of a large number of small spherical particles. Moreover, we deduce that the effective mean-field description holds true in the particular limit of vanishing surface-area density of particles.

Canonical singular hermitian metrics on relative canonical bundles - We introduce a new class of canonical AZD's (called the supercanonical AZD's) on the canonical bundles of smooth projective varieties with pseudoeffective canonical classes. We study the variation of the supercanonical AZD $\hat{h}_{can}$ under projective deformations and give a new proof of the invariance of plurigenera.

Yield Curve Shapes and the Asymptotic Short Rate Distribution in Affine One-Factor Models - We consider a model for interest rates, where the short rate is given by a time-homogenous, one-dimensional affine process in the sense of Duffie, Filipovic and Schachermayer. We show that in such a model yield curves can only be normal, inverse or humped (i.e. endowed with a single local maximum). Each case can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. We give conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limit distribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulant generating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model, a CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.

Thermally Stimulated Luminescence and Current in new heterocyclic materials for Organic field transistors and organic light emitting diodes - The present work is focused on theoretical and experimental study of localised levels in organic materials suitable for light-emitting devices and field effect transistors by means of thermal techniques. In our work we focused on low molecular compounds as well as on polymers, especially of two classes of materials: oxadiazoles and quinoxalines. Both organic compounds are well know as electron transport materials in OLEDs.

A microfluidic device based on droplet storage for screening solubility diagrams - This work describes a new microfluidic device developed for rapid screening of solubility diagrams. In several parallel channels, hundreds of nanoliter-volume droplets of a given solution are first stored with a gradual variation in the solute concentration. Then, the application of a temperature gradient along these channels enables us to read directly and quantitatively phase diagrams, concentration vs. temperature. We show, using a solution of adipic acid, that we can measure ten points of the solubility curve in less than 1 hr and with only 250 $\mu$L of solution.

Composite fermion wave functions as conformal field theory correlators - It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$, constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and $t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other fractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling fractions not contained in the principal Jain series.

$\Bz\to\pip\pim\piz$ Time Dependent Dalitz analysis at BaBar - I present here results of a time-dependent analysis of the Dalitz structure of neutral $B$ meson decays to $\pip\pim\piz$ from a dataset of 346 million $B \bar B$ pairs collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ center of mass energy by the BaBar detector at the SLAC PEP-II $e^+e^-$ accelerator. No significant CP violation effects are observed and 68% confidence interval is derived on the weak angle $\alpha$ to be [75$^o$,152$^o$]

New Organic thermally stable materials for optoelectronics devices - A linear spectroscopy study - Thermally stable polymers have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential use as the active component in electronic, optical and optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes, light emitting electrochemical cells, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, field effect transistors, optocouplers and optically pumped lasers in solution and solid state.We report results of investigations into the use of thermal treatment of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) films grown on a variety of substrates (quartz and glass). Film thickness, morphology and structural properties were investigated by a range of techniques in particular: atomic force microscope - AFM, DEKTAK method, Ellipsometry and UV-VIS spectroscopy.

Elativistic treatment in}$D$ - Dimensions to a spin-zero particle with noncentral equal scalar and vector ring-shaped Kratzer potential - The Klein-Gordon equation in D-dimensions for a recently proposed Kratzer potential plus ring-shaped potential is solved analytically by means of the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The exact energy bound-states and the corresponding wave functions of the Klein-Gordon are obtained in the presence of the noncentral equal scalar and vector potentials. The results obtained in this work are more general and can be reduced to the standard forms in three-dimensions given by other works.

On the potential of transit surveys in star clusters: Impact of correlated noise and radial velocity follow-up - We present an extension of the formalism recently proposed by Pepper & Gaudi to evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems, incorporating the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on the detectability of transits, and simultaneously incorporating the magnitude limits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates. New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined. Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial velocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby (<100 pc) clusters.

A non-perturbative proof of Bertrand's theorem - We discuss an alternative non-perturbative proof of Bertrand's theorem that leads in a concise way directly to the two allowed fields: the newtonian and the isotropic harmonic oscillator central fields.

Neutron-Capture Elements in the Double-Enhanced Star HE 1305-0007: a New s- and r-Process Paradigm - The star HE 1305-0007 is a metal-poor double-enhanced star with metallicity [Fe/H] $=-2.0$, which is just at the upper limit of the metallicity for the observed double-enhanced stars. Using a parametric model, we find that almost all s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be a member of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material has experienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and is dredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of common-envelope evolution. Based on the high radial-velocity of HE 1305-0007, we speculate that the star could be a runaway star from a binary system, in which the AIC event has occurred and produced the r-process elements.

Membrane in M5-branes Background - In this paper, we investigate the properties of a membrane in the M5-brane background. Through solving the classical equations of motion of the membrane, we can understand the classical dynamics of the membrane in this background.

3D photospheric velocity field of a Supergranular cell - We investigate the plasma flow properties inside a Supergranular (SG) cell, in particular its interaction with small scale magnetic field structures. The SG cell has been identified using the magnetic network (CaII wing brightness) as proxy, applying the Two-Level Structure Tracking (TST) to high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution observations obtained by IBIS. The full 3D velocity vector field for the SG has been reconstructed at two different photospheric heights. In order to strengthen our findings, we also computed the mean radial flow of the SG by means of cork tracing. We also studied the behaviour of the horizontal and Line of Sight plasma flow cospatial with cluster of bright CaII structures of magnetic origin to better understand the interaction between photospheric convection and small scale magnetic features. The SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flow from its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probably created by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. On the edge of the SG, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are nearby or cospatial with extended clusters of bright CaII wing features forming the knots of the magnetic network.

Substructures in WINGS clusters - We search for and characterize substructures in the projected distribution of galaxies observed in the wide field CCD images of the 77 nearby clusters of the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS). This sample is complete in X-ray flux in the redshift range 0.04<z<0.07. We search for substructures in WINGS clusters with DEDICA, an adaptive-kernel procedure. We test the procedure on Monte-Carlo simulations of the observed frames and determine the reliability for the detected structures. DEDICA identifies at least one reliable structure in the field of 55 clusters. 40 of these clusters have a total of 69 substructures at the same redshift of the cluster (redshift estimates of substructures are from color-magnitude diagrams). The fraction of clusters with subclusters (73%) is higher than in most studies. The presence of subclusters affects the relative luminosities of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Down to L ~ 10^11.2 L_Sun, our observed differential distribution of subcluster luminosities is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the differential mass function of substructures in cosmological simulations.

Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic particles - We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence of spinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles under the combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, for different combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find that the magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropy axes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degree flips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolar interaction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures, antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to aging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition, these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disordered structures.

Counting characters in linear group actions - Let $G$ be a finite group and $V$ be a finite $G$--module. We present upper bounds for the cardinalities of certain subsets of $\Irr(GV)$, such as the set of those $\chi\in\Irr(GV)$ such that, for a fixed $v\in V$, the restriction of $\chi$ to $<v>$ is not a multiple of the regular character of $<v>$. These results might be useful in attacking the non--coprime $k(GV)$--problem.

Continuous interfaces with disorder: Even strong pinning is too weak in 2 dimensions - We consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions without disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero. How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2 dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the pinning force tends to infinity.

On the KK-theory of strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras - Let $\Dh$ and $A$ be unital and separable $C^{*}$-algebras; let $\Dh$ be strongly self-absorbing. It is known that any two unital $^*$-homomorphisms from $\Dh$ to $A \otimes \Dh$ are approximately unitarily equivalent. We show that, if $\Dh$ is also $K_{1}$-injective, they are even asymptotically unitarily equivalent. This in particular implies that any unital endomorphism of $\Dh$ is asymptotically inner. Moreover, the space of automorphisms of $\Dh$ is compactly-contractible (in the point-norm topology) in the sense that for any compact Hausdorff space $X$, the set of homotopy classes $[X,\Aut(\Dh)]$ reduces to a point. The respective statement holds for the space of unital endomorphisms of $\Dh$. As an application, we give a description of the Kasparov group $KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ in terms of $^*$-homomorphisms and asymptotic unitary equivalence. Along the way, we show that the Kasparov group $KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ is isomorphic to $K_0(A\ot \Dh)$.

Effective interactions from q-deformed inspired transformations - From the mass term for the transformed quark fields, we obtain effective contact interactions of the NJL type. The parameters of the model that maps a system of non-interacting transformed fields into quarks interacting via NJL contact terms are discussed.

Magnetospectroscopy of epitaxial few-layer graphene - The inter-Landau level transitions observed in far-infrared transmission experiments on few-layer graphene samples show a behaviour characteristic of the linear dispersion expected in graphene. This behaviour persists in relatively thick samples, and is qualitatively different from that of thin samples of bulk graphite.

Dust Formation and Survival in Supernova Ejecta - The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet, observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant. We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between 2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

Preferential interaction coefficient for nucleic acids and other cylindrical poly-ions - The thermodynamics of nucleic acid processes is heavily affected by the electric double-layer of micro-ions around the polyions. We focus here on the Coulombic contribution to the salt-polyelectrolyte preferential interaction (Donnan) coefficient and we report extremely accurate analytical expressions valid in the range of low salt concentration (when polyion radius is smaller than the Debye length). The analysis is performed at Poisson-Boltzmann level, in cylindrical geometry, with emphasis on highly charged poly-ions (beyond ``counter-ion condensation''). The results hold for any electrolyte of the form $z_-$:$z_+$. We also obtain a remarkably accurate expression for the electric potential in the vicinity of the poly-ion.

A new approach to mutual information - A new expression as a certain asymptotic limit via "discrete micro-states" of permutations is provided to the mutual information of both continuous and discrete random variables.

Analysis of the real estate market in Las Vegas: Bubble, seasonal patterns, and prediction of the CSW indexes - We analyze 27 house price indexes of Las Vegas from Jun. 1983 to Mar. 2005, corresponding to 27 different zip codes. These analyses confirm the existence of a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than exponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time interval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has progressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to pre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a medium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly periodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from month to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could confirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned to ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution of the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep. 2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant variations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems to have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two years earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of the USA).

A Low Complexity Algorithm and Architecture for Systematic Encoding of Hermitian Codes - We present an algorithm for systematic encoding of Hermitian codes. For a Hermitian code defined over GF(q^2), the proposed algorithm achieves a run time complexity of O(q^2) and is suitable for VLSI implementation. The encoder architecture uses as main blocks q varying-rate Reed-Solomon encoders and achieves a space complexity of O(q^2) in terms of finite field multipliers and memory elements.

Quantum criticality and disorder in the antiferromagnetic critical point of NiS$_{2}$ pyrite - A quantum critical point (QCP) between the antiferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases was realized by applying a hydrostatic pressure of ~ 7 GPa on single crystals of NiS_{2} pyrite with a low residual resistivity, rho_{0}, of 0.5 mu-Omega-cm. We found that the critical behavior of the resistivity, rho, in this clean system contrasts sharply with those observed in its disordered analogue, NiS_{2-x}Se_{x} solid-solution, demonstrating the unexpectedly drastic effect of disorder on the quantum criticality. Over a whole paramagnetic region investigated up to P = 9 GPa, a crossover temperature, defined as the onset of T^{2} dependence of rho, an indication of Fermi liquid, was suppressed to a substantially low temperature T sim 2 K and, instead, a non Fermi liquid behavior of rho, T^{3/2}-dependence, robustly showed up.

Spin coherence of holes in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells - The carrier spin coherence in a p-doped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum well with a diluted hole gas has been studied by picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation with an in-plane magnetic field. For resonant optical excitation of the positively charged exciton the spin precession shows two types of oscillations. Fast oscillating electron spin beats decay with the radiative lifetime of the charged exciton of 50 ps. Long lived spin coherence of the holes with dephasing times up to 650 ps. The spin dephasing time as well as the in-plane hole g factor show strong temperature dependence, underlining the importance of hole localization at cryogenic temperatures.

Local-field effects in radiatively broadened magneto-dielectric media: negative refraction and absorption reduction - We give a microscopic derivation of the Clausius-Mossotti relations for a homogeneous and isotropic magneto-dielectric medium consisting of radiatively broadened atomic oscillators. To this end the diagram series of electromagnetic propagators is calculated exactly for an infinite bi-cubic lattice of dielectric and magnetic dipoles for a lattice constant small compared to the resonance wavelength $\lambda$. Modifications of transition frequencies and linewidth of the elementary oscillators are taken into account in a selfconsistent way by a proper incorporation of the singular self-interaction terms. We show that in radiatively broadened media sufficiently close to the free-space resonance the real part of the index of refraction approaches the value -2 in the limit of $\rho \lambda^3 \gg 1$, where $\rho$ is the number density of scatterers. Since at the same time the imaginary part vanishes as $1/\rho$ local field effects can have important consequences for realizing low-loss negative index materials.

Search for a fourth generation b'-quark at LEP-II at sqrt{s}=196-209 GeV - A search for the pair production of fourth generation b'-quarks was performed using data taken by the DELPHI detector at LEP-II. The analysed data were collected at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 196 to 209 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 420 pb^{-1}. No evidence for a signal was found. Upper limits on BR(b' -> bZ) and BR(b' -> cW) were obtained for b' masses ranging from 96 to 103 GeV/c^2. These limits, together with the theoretical branching ratios predicted by a sequential four generations model, were used to constrain the value of R_{CKM}=|V_{cb'}/V_{tb'}V_{tb}|, where V_{cb'}, V_{tb'} and V_{tb} are elements of the extended CKM matrix.

About curvature, conformal metrics and warped products - We consider the curvature of a family of warped products of two pseduo-Riemannian manifolds $(B,g_B)$ and $(F,g_F)$ furnished with metrics of the form $c^{2}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$ and, in particular, of the type $w^{2 \mu}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$, where $c, w \colon B \to (0,\infty)$ are smooth functions and $\mu$ is a real parameter. We obtain suitable expressions for the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of such products that allow us to establish results about the existence of Einstein or constant scalar curvature structures in these categories. If $(B,g_B)$ is Riemannian, the latter question involves nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations with concave-convex nonlinearities and singular partial differential equations of the Lichnerowicz-York type among others.

The local structure of conformally symmetric manifolds - This is a final step in a local classification of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with parallel Weyl tensor that are not conformally flat or locally symmetric.

Investigation of Colour Reconnection in WW Events with the DELPHI detector at LEP-2 - In the reaction e+e- -> WW -> (q_1 qbar_2)(q_3 qbar_4) the usual hadronization models treat the colour singlets q_1 qbar_2 and q_3 qbar_4 coming from two W bosons independently. However, since the final state partons may coexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systems may be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. This effect is known as Colour Reconnection. In this article the results of the investigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of W pairs in DELPHI at LEP are presented. Two complementary analyses were performed, studying the particle flow between jets and W mass estimators, with negligible correlation between them, and the results were combined and compared to models. In the framework of the SK-I model, the value for its kappa parameter most compatible with the data was found to be: kappa_{SK-I} = 2.2^{+2.5}_{-1.3} corresponding to the probability of reconnection P_{reco} to be in the range 0.31 < P_{reco} < 0.68 at 68% confidence level with its best value at 0.52.

Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG): A Model of Self Organizing Network from Input Categorization - Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply physical sense- the term gas here used.

X-ray Dichroism and the Pseudogap Phase of Cuprates - A recent polarized x-ray absorption experiment on the high temperature cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 indicates the presence of broken parity symmetry below the temperature, T*, where a pseudogap appears in photoemission. We critically analyze the x-ray data, and conclude that a parity-breaking signal of the kind suggested is unlikely based on the crystal structures reported in the literature. Possible other origins of the observed dichroism signal are discussed. We propose x-ray scattering experiments that can be done in order to determine whether such alternative interpretations are valid or not.

Solvability of linear equations within weak mixing sets - We introduce a new class of "random" subsets of natural numbers, WM sets. This class contains normal sets (sets whose characteristic function is a normal binary sequence). We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of systems of linear equations within every WM set and within every normal set. We also show that partition-regular system of linear equations with integer coefficients is solvable in any WM set.

D-\bar D mixing and rare D decays in the Littlest Higgs model with non-unitarity matrix - We study the $D-\bar D$ mixing and rare D decays in the Littlest Higgs model. As the new weak singlet quark with the electric charge of 2/3 is introduced to cancel the quadratic divergence induced by the top-quark, the standard unitary $3\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is extended to a non-unitary $4\times 3$ matrix in the quark charged currents and Z-mediated flavor changing neutral currents are generated at tree level. In this model, we show that the $D-\bar D$ mixing parameter can be as large as the current experimental value and the decay branching ratio (BR) of $D\to X_u \ga$ is small but its direct CP asymmetry could be $O(10%)$. In addition, we find that the BRs of $D\to X_u \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$, $D\to X_u\nu \bar \nu$ and $D\to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ could be enhanced to be $O(10^{-9})$, $O(10^{-8})$ and $O(10^{-9})$, respectively.

Alternative Large Nc Schemes and Chiral Dynamics - We compare the dependences on the number of colors of the leading pion pion scattering amplitudes using the single index quark field and two index quark fields. These are seen to have different relationships to the scattering amplitudes suggested by chiral dynamics which can explain the long puzzling pion pion s wave scattering up to about 1 GeV. This may be interesting for getting a better understanding of the large Nc approach as well as for application to recently proposed technicolor models.

The height dependence of temperature - velocity correlation in the solar photosphere - We derive correlation coefficients between temperature and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth throughout the solar photosphere for the non-magnetic photosphere and a small area of enhanced magnetic activity. The maximum anticorrelation of about -0.6 between temperature and line-of-sight velocity in the non-magnetic photosphere occurs at log tau5 = -0.4. The magnetic field is another decorrelating factor along with 5-min oscillations and seeing.

Magnetism in the high-Tc analogue Cs2AgF4 studied with muon-spin relaxation - We present the results of a muon-spin relaxation study of the high-Tc analogue material Cs2AgF4. We find unambiguous evidence for magnetic order, intrinsic to the material, below T_C=13.95(3) K. The ratio of inter- to intraplane coupling is estimated to be |J'/J|=1.9 x 10^-2, while fits of the temperature dependence of the order parameter reveal a critical exponent beta=0.292(3), implying an intermediate character between pure two- and three- dimensional magnetism in the critical regime. Above T_C we observe a signal characteristic of dipolar interactions due to linear F-mu-F bonds, allowing the muon stopping sites in this compound to be characterized.

Reconciling the X(3872) with the near-threshold enhancement in the D^0\bar{D}^{*0} final state - We investigate the enhancement in the D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0 final state with the mass M=3875.2\pm 0.7^{+0.3}_{-1.6}\pm 0.8 MeV found recently by the Belle Collaboration in the B\to K D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0 decay and test the possibility that this is yet another manifestation of the well-established resonance X(3872). We perform a combined Flatte analysis of the data for the D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0 mode, and for the \pi^+\pi^- J/\psi mode of the X(3872). Only if the X(3872) is a virtual state in the D^0\bar{D}^{*0} channel, the data on the new enhancement comply with those on the X(3872). In our fits, the mass distribution in the D^0\bar{D}^{*0} mode exhibits a peak at 2-3 MeV above the D^0\bar{D}^{*0} threshold, with a distinctive non-Breit-Wigner shape.

Three-dimensional effects in "atom diodes": atom-optical devices for one-way motion - The ``atom diode'' is a laser device that lets the ground state atom pass in one direction but not in the opposite direction. We examine three-dimensional effects of that device for arbitrary atomic incidence angles on flat laser sheets and set breakdown limiting angles and velocities. It is found that a correct diodic behavior independent of the incident angle can be obtained with blue detuned lasers.

Plasmon Amplification through Stimulated Emission at Terahertz Frequencies in Graphene - We show that plasmons in two-dimensional graphene can have net gain at terahertz frequencies. The coupling of the plasmons to interband electron-hole transitions in population inverted graphene layers can lead to plasmon amplification through the process of stimulated emission. We calculate plasmon gain for different electron-hole densities and temperatures and show that the gain values can exceed $10^{4}$ cm$^{-1}$ in the 1-10 terahertz frequency range, for electron-hole densities in the $10^{9}$-$10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ range, even when plasmon energy loss due to intraband scattering is considered. Plasmons are found to exhibit net gain for intraband scattering times shorter than 100 fs. Such high gain values could allow extremely compact terahertz amplifiers and oscillators that have dimensions in the 1-10 $\mu$m range.

On the homology of two-dimensional elimination - We study birational maps with empty base locus defined by almost complete intersection ideals. Birationality is shown to be expressed by the equality of two Chern numbers. We provide a relatively effective method of their calculation in terms of certain Hilbert coefficients. In dimension two the structure of the irreducible ideals leads naturally to the calculation of Sylvester determinants via a computer-assisted method. For degree at most 5 we produce the full set of defining equations of the base ideal. The results answer affirmatively some questions raised by D. Cox.

The effectiveness of quantum operations for eavesdropping on sealed messages - A quantum protocol is described which enables a user to send sealed messages and that allows for the detection of active eavesdroppers. We examine a class of eavesdropping strategies, those that make use of quantum operations, and we determine the information gain versus disturbance caused by these strategies. We demonstrate this tradeoff with an example and we compare this protocol to quantum key distribution, quantum direct communication, and quantum seal protocols.

Shocks in nonlocal media - We investigate the formation of collisionless shocks along the spatial profile of a gaussian laser beam propagating in nonlocal nonlinear media. For defocusing nonlinearity the shock survives the smoothing effect of the nonlocal response, though its dynamics is qualitatively affected by the latter, whereas for focusing nonlinearity it dominates over filamentation. The patterns observed in a thermal defocusing medium are interpreted in the framework of our theory.

Modeling the field of laser welding melt pool by RBFNN - Efficient control of a laser welding process requires the reliable prediction of process behavior. A statistical method of field modeling, based on normalized RBFNN, can be successfully used to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface optical activity in the laser welding process. In this article we demonstrate how to optimize RBFNN to maximize prediction quality. Special attention is paid to the structure of sample vectors, which represent the bridge between the field distributions in the past and future.

Solving The High Energy Evolution Equation Including Running Coupling Corrections - We study the solution of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with the recently calculated running coupling corrections [hep-ph/0609105, hep-ph/0609090]. Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result of [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included. These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with the running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very large rapidity.

Anomalous c-axis transport in layered metals - Transport in metals with strongly anisotropic single-particle spectrum is studied. Coherent band transport in all directions, described by the standard Boltzmann equation, is shown to withstand both elastic and inelastic scattering as long as $E_F\tau\gg 1$. A model of phonon-assisted tunneling via resonant states located in between the layers is suggested to explain a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the c-axis resistivity observed in experiments.

Proper holomorphic mappings of the spectral unit ball - We prove an Alexander type theorem for the spectral unit ball $\Omega_n$ showing that there are no non-trivial proper holomorphic mappings in $\Omega_n$, $n\geq 2$.

Parsimony via concensus - The parsimony score of a character on a tree equals the number of state changes required to fit that character onto the tree. We show that for unordered, reversible characters this score equals the number of tree rearrangements required to fit the tree onto the character. We discuss implications of this connection for the debate over the use of consensus trees or total evidence, and show how it provides a link between incongruence of characters and recombination.

Millimeter imaging of HD 163296: probing the disk structure and kinematics - We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations of the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arrays both in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dust properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7 mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane. The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200 AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally, we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O. We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the dust distribution by a low mass companion.

Spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II 8498 A and 8542 A lines in the quiet Sun - The Ca II infrared triplet is one of the few magnetically sensitive chromospheric lines available for ground-based observations. We present spectropolarimetric observations of the 8498 A and 8542 A lines in a quiet Sun region near a decaying active region and compare the results with a simulation of the lines in a high plasma-beta regime. Cluster analysis of Stokes V profile pairs shows that the two lines, despite arguably being formed fairly close, often do not have similar shapes. In the network, the local magnetic topology is more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the phase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the observed amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the simulation. Both the network and internetwork show oscillatory behavior in the Ca II lines. It is stronger in the network, where shocking waves, similar to those in the high-beta simulation, are seen and large self-reversals in the intensity profiles are common.

Number of moduli of irreducible families of plane curves with nodes and cusps - Consider the family S of irreducible plane curves of degree n with d nodes and k cusps as singularities. Let W be an irreducible component of S. We consider the natural rational map from W to the moduli space of curves of genus g=(n-1)(n-2)/2-d-k. We define the "number of moduli of W" as the dimension of the image of W with respect to this map. If W has the expected dimension equal to 3n+g-1-k, then the number of moduli of W is at most equal to the min(3g-3, 3g-3+\rho-k), dove \rho is the Brill-Neother number of the linear series of degree n and dimension 2 on a smooth curve of genus g. We say that W has the expected number of moduli if the equality holds. In this paper we construct examples of families of irreducible plane curves with nodes and cusps as singularities having expected number of moduli and with non-positive Brill-Noether number.

Search for Heavy Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons with CMS: Reach and Higgs-Mass Precision - The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. We analyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs bosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by combining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on full simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM Higgs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should be achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM parameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM Higgs bosons at the LHC.

White dwarf masses derived from planetary nebulae modelling - We compare the mass distribution of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN) with those of their progeny, white dwarfs (WD). We use a dynamical method to measure masses with an uncertainty of 0.02 M$_\odot$. The CSPN mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaks at lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses. Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is faster than predicted by the Bl\"ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by observational or model uncertainties.

Uniqueness theorems for Cauchy integrals - If $\mu$ is a finite complex measure in the complex plane $\C$ we denote by $C^\mu$ its Cauchy integral defined in the sense of principal value. The measure $\mu$ is called reflectionless if it is continuous (has no atoms) and $C^\mu=0$ at $\mu$-almost every point. We show that if $\mu$ is reflectionless and its Cauchy maximal function $C^\mu_*$ is summable with respect to $|\mu|$ then $\mu$ is trivial. An example of a reflectionless measure whose maximal function belongs to the "weak" $L^1$ is also constructed, proving that the above result is sharp in its scale. We also give a partial geometric description of the set of reflectionless measures on the line and discuss connections of our results with the notion of sets of finite perimeter in the sense of De Giorgi.

On the number of moduli of plane sextics with six cusps - Let S be the variety of irreducible sextics with six cusps as singularities. Let W be one of irreducible components of W. Denoting by M_4 the space of moduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational map from W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D, to the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number of moduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect to the moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven. In this paper we prove that both irreducible components of S have number of moduli exactly equal to seven.

Algorithm for anisotropic diffusion in hydrogen-bonded networks - In this paper I describe a specialized algorithm for anisotropic diffusion determined by a field of transition rates. The algorithm can be used to describe some interesting forms of diffusion that occur in the study of proton motion in a network of hydrogen bonds. The algorithm produces data that require a nonstandard method of spectral analysis which is also developed here. Finally, I apply the algorithm to a simple specific example.

Temporal Evolution of Step-Edge Fluctuations Under Electromigration Conditions - The temporal evolution of step-edge fluctuations under electromigration conditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$, and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For $t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate time-scale.

Renormgroup origin and analysis of Split Higgsino scenario - We present a renormalization group motivation of scale hierarchies in SUSY SU(5) model. The Split Higgsino scanrio with a high scale of the SUSY breaking is considered in detail. Its manifestations in experiments are discussed.

Probing dark energy with steerable wavelets through correlation of WMAP and NVSS local morphological measures - Using local morphological measures on the sphere defined through a steerable wavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for correlation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity, orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the Universe. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for dark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to help us to better understand the nature of dark energy.

Electromagnetic structure and weak decay of meson K in a light-front QCD-inspired - The kaon electromagnetic (e.m.) form factor is reviewed considering a light-front constituent quark model. In this approach, it is discussed the relevance of the quark-antiquark pair terms for the full covariance of the e.m. current. It is also verified, by considering a QCD dynamical model, that a good agreement with experimental data can be obtained for the kaon weak decay constant once a probability of about 80% of the valence component is taken into account.

Black hole puncture initial data with realistic gravitational wave content - We present improved post-Newtonian-inspired initial data for non-spinning black-hole binaries, suitable for numerical evolution with punctures. We revisit the work of Tichy et al. [W. Tichy, B. Bruegmann, M. Campanelli, and P. Diener, Phys. Rev. D 67, 064008 (2003)], explicitly calculating the remaining integral terms. These terms improve accuracy in the far zone and, for the first time, include realistic gravitational waves in the initial data. We investigate the behavior of these data both at the center of mass and in the far zone, demonstrating agreement of the transverse-traceless parts of the new metric with quadrupole-approximation waveforms. These data can be used for numerical evolutions, enabling a direct connection between the merger waveforms and the post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms.

Measurement of the Decay Constant $f_D{_S^+}$ using $D_S^+ --> ell^+ nu - We measure the decay constant fDs using the Ds -> l+ nu channel, where the l+ designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+ -> pi+ nu. Using both measurements we find fDs = 274 +-13 +- 7 MeV. Combining with our previous determination of fD+, we compute the ratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. We compare with theoretical estimates.

The $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^-$, $K^+ K^- \pi^0\pi^0$ and $K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ Cross Sections Measured with Initial-State Radiation - We study the processes $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, $K^+K^-\pi^0\pi^0\gamma$ and $K^+ K^- K^+ K^-\gamma$, where the photon is radiated from the initial state. About 34600, 4400 and 2300 fully reconstructed events, respectively, are selected from 232 \invfb of \babar data. The invariant mass of the hadronic final state defines the effective \epem center-of-mass energy, so that the $K^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ data can be compared with direct measurements of the $e^+ e^-\to K^+K^- \pipi$ reaction; no direct measurements exist for the $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^- \pi^0\pi^0$ or $\epem\to K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ reactions. Studying the structure of these events, we find contributions from a number of intermediate states, and we extract their cross sections where possible. In particular, we isolate the contribution from $e^+ e^-\to\phi(1020) f_{0}(980)$ and study its structure near threshold. In the charmonium region, we observe the $J/\psi$ in all three final states and several intermediate states, as well as the $\psi(2S)$ in some modes, and measure the corresponding branching fractions. We see no signal for the Y(4260) and obtain an upper limit of $\BR_{Y(4260)\to\phi\pi^+\pi^-}\cdot\Gamma^{Y}_{ee}<0.4 \ev$ at 90% C.L.

Orthogonality criterion for banishing hydrino states from standard quantum mechanics - Orthogonality criterion is used to shown in a very simple and general way that anomalous bound-state solutions for the Coulomb potential (hydrino states) do not exist as bona fide solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.

Detecting and Characterizing Planetary Systems with Transit Timing - In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future. A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5 {\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

d-wave superconductivity from electron-phonon interactions - I examine electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in the intermediate coupling and phonon frequency regime of the quasi-2D Holstein model. I use an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory which includes vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations. I find a d-wave superconducting state that is unique close to half-filling. The order parameter undergoes a transition to s-wave superconductivity on increasing filling. I explain how the inclusion of both vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations is essential for the prediction of a d-wave order parameter. I then discuss the effects of a large Coulomb pseudopotential on the superconductivity (such as is found in contemporary superconducting materials like the cuprates), which results in the destruction of the s-wave states, while leaving the d-wave states unmodified.

A Finite Element framework for computation of protein normal modes and mechanical response - A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model, proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model, including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular assemblies of unknown atomic structure.

Reply to 'Comment on 'Heavy element production in inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis'' - This is a reply report to astro-ph/0604264. We studied heavy element production in high baryon density region in early universe astro-ph/0507439. However it is claimed in astro-ph/0604264 that small scale but high baryon density region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or in order not to contradict to observations high density region must be so small that it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance. In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in high baryon density region and show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enough amount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light element observations.

Sum-over-states vs quasiparticle pictures of coherent correlation spectroscopy of excitons in semiconductors; femtosecond analogues of multidimensional NMR - Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCS) based on the nonlinear optical response of excitons to sequences of ultrafast pulses, has the potential to provide some unique insights into carrier dynamics in semiconductors. The most prominent feature of 2DCS, cross peaks, can best be understood using a sum-over-states picture involving the many-body eigenstates. However, the optical response of semiconductors is usually calculated by solving truncated equations of motion for dynamical variables, which result in a quasiparticle picture. In this work we derive Green's function expressions for the four wave mixing signals generated in various phase-matching directions and use them to establish the connection between the two pictures. The formal connection with Frenkel excitons (hard-core bosons) and vibrational excitons (soft-core bosons) is pointed out.

Are constant loop widths an artifact of the background and the spatial resolution? - We study the effect of the coronal background in the determination of the diameter of EUV loops, and we analyze the suitability of the procedure followed in a previous paper (L\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\'emoulin 2006) for characterizing their expansion properties. For the analysis we create different synthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these loops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the results with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do not expand systematically with height is robust.

Polarizations of J/psi and psi(2S) Mesons Produced in ppbar Collisions at 1.96 TeV - We have measured the polarizations of $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ mesons as functions of their transverse momentum $\pt$ when they are produced promptly in the rapidity range $|y|<0.6$ with $\pt \geq 5 \pgev$. The analysis is performed using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about $800 \ipb$ collected by the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizations become increasingly longitudinal as $\pt$ increases from 5 to $30 \pgev$. These results are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ mesons from $B$-hadron decays are also reported.

A measure of the non-Gaussian character of a quantum state - We address the issue of quantifying the non-Gaussian character of a bosonic quantum state and introduce a non-Gaussianity measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state under examination and a reference Gaussian state. We analyze in details the properties of the proposed measure and exploit it to evaluate the non-Gaussianity of some relevant single- and multi-mode quantum states. The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzed for quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss and de-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easily computable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a corresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.

Skew-Hadamard matrices of orders 188 and 388 exist - We construct several difference families on cyclic groups of orders 47 and 97, and use them to construct skew-Hadamard matrices of orders 188 and 388. Such difference families and matrices are constructed here for the first time. The matrices are constructed by using the Goethals-Seidel array.

Quantum engineering of photon states with entangled atomic ensembles - We propose and analyze a new method to produce single and entangled photons which does not require cavities. It relies on the collective enhancement of light emission as a consequence of the presence of entanglement in atomic ensembles. Light emission is triggered by a laser pulse, and therefore our scheme is deterministic. Furthermore, it allows one to produce a variety of photonic entangled states by first preparing certain atomic states using simple sequences of quantum gates. We analyze the feasibility of our scheme, and particularize it to: ions in linear traps, atoms in optical lattices, and in cells at room temperature.

Direct photons and dileptons via color dipoles - Drell-Yan dilepton pair production and inclusive direct photon production can be described within a unified framework in the color dipole approach. The inclusion of non-perturbative primordial transverse momenta and DGLAP evolution is studied. We successfully describe data for dilepton spectra from 800-GeV pp collisions, inclusive direct photon spectra for pp collisions at RHIC energies $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV, and for $p\bar{p}$ collisions at Tevatron energies $\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV, in a formalism that is free from any extra parameters.

Mapping the Youngest Galaxies to Redshift One - We describe results of a narrow band search for ultra-strong emission line galaxies (USELs) with EW(H beta) > 30 A. 542 candidate galaxies are found in a half square degree survey using two ~100 Angstrom 8150 A and 9140 A filters with Subaru/SuprimeCam. Followup spectroscopy for randomly selected objects in the sample with KeckII/DEIMOS shows they consist of [OIII] 5007, [OII] 3727, and H alpha selected strong-emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z < 1), and Ly alpha emitting galaxies at high-redshift (z >> 5). We determine the H beta luminosity functions and the star formation density of the USELs, which is 5-10% of the value found from ultraviolet continuum objects at z=0-1, suggesting they correspond to a major epoch in galaxy formation at these redshifts. Many USELs show the temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral lines and about a dozen have oxygen abundances characteristic of eXtremely Metal Poor Galaxies (XMPGs). These XMPGs are the most distant known today. Our high yield rate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations. The lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O/H) = 7.06 (6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. The luminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent with the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggest that galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z < 1.

On the HOMFLY and Tutte polynomials - A celebrated result of F. Jaeger states that the Tutte polynomial of a planar graph is determined by the HOMFLY polynomial of an associated link. Here we are interested in the converse of this result. We consider the question `to what extent does the Tutte polynomial determine the HOMFLY polynomial of any knot?' We show that the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot is determined by Tutte polynomials of plane graphs associated to the knot.

Discovery of extreme asymmetry in the debris disk surrounding HD 15115 - We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the optical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius, whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in the Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115 that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic space velocity, and age.

The Mathematical Universe - I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) that there exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans. I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it implies the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH and MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness. I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical systems.

Testing String Theory with CMB - Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory. Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r < 0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may present a challenge to string cosmology. The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r > 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for particle phenomenology based on string theory.

Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model - In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse. It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined. The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance to hemodynamics has been outlined.

Quivers with potentials and their representations I: Mutations - We study quivers with relations given by non-commutative analogs of Jacobian ideals in the complete path algebra. This framework allows us to give a representation-theoretic interpretation of quiver mutations at arbitrary vertices. This gives a far-reaching generalization of Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection functors. The motivations for this work come from several sources: superpotentials in physics, Calabi-Yau algebras, cluster algebras.

Coherent macroscopic quantum tunneling in boson-fermion mixtures - We show that the cold atom systems of simultaneously trapped Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC's) and quantum degenerate fermionic atoms provide promising laboratories for the study of macroscopic quantum tunneling. Our theoretical studies reveal that the spatial extent of a small trapped BEC immersed in a Fermi sea can tunnel and coherently oscillate between the values of the separated and mixed configurations (the phases of the phase separation transition of BEC-fermion systems). We evaluate the period, amplitude and dissipation rate for $^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K-atoms and we discuss the experimental prospects for observing this phenomenon.

Efficiency of thin film photocells - We propose a new concept for the design of high-efficiency photocells based on ultra-thin (submicron) semiconductor films of controlled thickness. Using a microscopic model of a thin dielectric layer interacting with incident electromagnetic radiation we evaluate the efficiency of conversion of solar radiation into the electric power. We determine the optimal range of parameters which maximize the efficiency of such photovoltaic element.

Galactic Wind Signatures around High Redshift Galaxies - We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI) absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

`St\"uckelberg interferometry' with ultracold molecules - We report on the realization of a time-domain `St\"uckelberg interferometer', which is based on the internal state structure of ultracold Feshbach molecules. Two subsequent passages through a weak avoided crossing between two different orbital angular momentum states in combination with a variable hold time lead to high-contrast population oscillations. This allows for a precise determination of the energy difference between the two molecular states. We demonstrate a high degree of control over the interferometer dynamics. The interferometric scheme provides new possibilities for precision measurements with ultracold molecules.

An integral field spectroscopic survey for high redshift damped Lyman-alpha galaxies - We search for galaxy counterparts to damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) at z>2 towards nine quasars, which have 14 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs in their spectra. We use integral field spectroscopy to search for Ly-alpha emission line objects at the redshifts of the absorption systems. Besides recovering two previously confirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alpha emission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengths close to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In comparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies the candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets between the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impact parameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found at larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from the QSO line of sight to the location of the candidate emission line, we find that the average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with an exponential scale length of ~5 kpc.

Exploring the Variable Sky with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS Stripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz system for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we compute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter than g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g and r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2) quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for quasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like behavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that it will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million low-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

Necessary optimality conditions for the calculus of variations on time scales - We study more general variational problems on time scales. Previous results are generalized by proving necessary optimality conditions for (i) variational problems involving delta derivatives of more than the first order, and (ii) problems of the calculus of variations with delta-differential side conditions (Lagrange problem of the calculus of variations on time scales).

The Boundary Conditions of the Heliosphere: Photoionization Models Constrained by Interstellar and In Situ Data - The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density and composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative transfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation field using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray background. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and the hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating because of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible range of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to radiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the heliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to constrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column densities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the observational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI) and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron density in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/- 0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with sub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however C is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and partially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and X(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are found for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low values for the reference solar abundances for the LIC composition.

Collective excitations in a magnetically doped quantized Hall ferromagnet - A theory of collective states in a magnetically quantized two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with half-filled Landau level (quantized Hall ferromagnet) in the presence of magnetic 3d impurities is developed. The spectrum of bound and delocalized spin-excitons as well as the renormalization of Zeeman splitting of the impurity 3d levels due to the indirect exchange interaction with the 2DEG are studied for the specific case of n-type GaAs doped with Mn where the Lande` g-factors of impurity and 2DEG have opposite signs. If the sign of the 2DEG g-factor is changed due to external influences, then impurity related transitions to new ground state phases, presenting various spin-flip and skyrmion-like textures, are possible. Conditions for existence of these phases are discussed. PACS: 73.43.Lp, 73.21.Fg, 72.15.Rn

Long Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors: Boundary Conditions and Binary Models - The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type Ic supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in which the GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive star to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies suggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the collapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star models are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive helium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during core-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few millennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent evolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence companions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars in close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the strong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain sufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.

Multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched dry DNA - When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch elastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence, using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched structure.

Ample subvarieties and rationally connected fibrations - Under some positivity assumptions, extension properties of rationally connected fibrations from a submanifold to its ambient variety are studied. Given a family of rational curves on a complex projective manifold X inducing a covering family on a submanifold Y with ample normal bundle in X, the main results relate, under suitable conditions, the associated rational connected fiber structures on X and on Y. Applications of these results include an extension theorem for Mori contractions of fiber type and a classification theorem in the case Y has a structure of projective bundle or quadric fibration.

Bounds for Multiplicities of Unitary Representations of Cohomological Type in Spaces of Cusp Forms - Let $\Goo$ be a semisimple real Lie group with unitary dual $\Ghat$. The goal of this note is to produce new upper bounds for the multiplicities with which representations $\pi \in \Ghat$ of cohomological type appear in certain spaces of cusp forms on $\Goo$.

Decoherence of Quantum-Enhanced Timing Accuracy - Quantum enhancement of optical pulse timing accuracy is investigated in the Heisenberg picture. Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, and Kerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studied via Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impact of decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control for beating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902 (2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that an appreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite an increase in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherence effect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timing information is also studied, in order to identify situations in which the enhancement is able to survive.

Stock market return distributions: from past to present - We show that recent stock market fluctuations are characterized by the cumulative distributions whose tails on short, minute time scales exhibit power scaling with the scaling index alpha > 3 and this index tends to increase quickly with decreasing sampling frequency. Our study is based on high-frequency recordings of the S&P500, DAX and WIG20 indices over the interval May 2004 - May 2006. Our findings suggest that dynamics of the contemporary market may differ from the one observed in the past. This effect indicates a constantly increasing efficiency of world markets.

Global well-posedness and scattering for the energy-critical, defocusing Hartree equation for radial data - We consider the defocusing, $\dot{H}^1$-critical Hartree equation for the radial data in all dimensions $(n\geq 5)$. We show the global well-posedness and scattering results in the energy space. The new ingredient in this paper is that we first take advantage of the term $\displaystyle - \int_{I}\int_{|x|\leq A|I|^{1/2}}|u|^{2}\Delta \Big(\frac{1}{|x|}\Big)dxdt$ in the localized Morawetz identity to rule out the possibility of energy concentration, instead of the classical Morawetz estimate dependent of the nonlinearity.

String inspired explanation for the super-acceleration of our universe - We investigate the effect of the bulk content in the general Gauss-Bonnet braneworld on the evolution of the universe. We find that the Gauss-Bonnet term and the combination of the dark radiation and the matter content of the bulk play a crucial role in the universe evolution. We show that our model can describe the super-acceleration of our universe with the equation of state of the effective dark energy in agreement with observations.

Topological Free Entropy Dimension of in Unital C^*-algebras - The notion of topological free entropy dimension of $n-$tuples of elements in a unital C$^*$ algebra was introduced by Voiculescu. In the paper, we compute topological free entropy dimension of one self-adjoint element and topological orbit dimension of one self-adjoint element in a unital C$^*$ algebra. Moreover, we calculate the values of topological free entropy dimensions of families of generators of some unital C$^*$ algebras (for example: irrational rotation C$^*$ algebras or minimal tensor product of two reduced C$^*$ algebras of free groups).

J/psi Production in an Equilibrating Partonic System - Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then expands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included here in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon collisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an indicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the rapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be -3<y<3.

Reduced and Extended Weak Coupling Limit - We give an extended review of recent work on the extended weak coupling limit. Background material on completely positive semigroups and their unitary dilations is given, as well as a particularly easy construction of `quadratic noises'.

Complete Set of Polarization Transfer Observables for the $^{12}{\rm C}(p,n)$ Reaction at 296 MeV and 0$^{\circ}$ - A complete set of polarization transfer observables has been measured for the $^{12}{\rm C}(p,n)$ reaction at $T_p=296 {\rm MeV}$ and $\theta_{\rm lab}=0^{\circ}$. The total spin transfer $\Sigma(0^{\circ})$ and the observable $f_1$ deduced from the measured polarization transfer observables indicate that the spin--dipole resonance at $E_x \simeq 7 {\rm MeV}$ has greater $2^-$ strength than $1^-$ strength, which is consistent with recent experimental and theoretical studies. The results also indicate a predominance of the spin-flip and unnatural-parity transition strength in the continuum. The exchange tensor interaction at a large momentum transfer of $Q \simeq 3.6 {\rm fm}^{-1}$ is discussed.

Learning from compressed observations - The problem of statistical learning is to construct a predictor of a random variable $Y$ as a function of a related random variable $X$ on the basis of an i.i.d. training sample from the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$. Allowable predictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach asymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the class. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the $X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some finite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the $X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors, the underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we give an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor performance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are illustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.

Hamiltonian formalism in Friedmann cosmology and its quantization - We propose a Hamiltonian formalism for a generalized Friedmann-Roberson-Walker cosmology model in the presence of both a variable equation of state (EOS) parameter $w(a)$ and a variable cosmological constant $\Lambda(a)$, where $a$ is the scale factor. This Hamiltonian system containing 1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the equation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass object moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the scale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant mass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized straightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.

Optimal stimulus and noise distributions for information transmission via suprathreshold stochastic resonance - Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal transmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical threshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of stochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input signals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small amounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR in the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for optimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical verification and justification for previous work in both computational neuroscience and electronics.

Three Different Types of Galaxy Alignment within Dark Matter Halos - Using a large galaxy group catalogue based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignment within groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignment between the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction towards its BGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its satellites. In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxies are preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r < 0.7 Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the direction to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, are perfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r < 0.1 \Rvir, we find a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellites and BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak lensing measurements.

Proto-Neutron Star Winds, Magnetar Birth, and Gamma-Ray Bursts - We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutron star (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, we then derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds for both relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including important multi-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we argue that proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods produce relativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities, timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable for producing long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

A very massive runaway star from Cygnus OB2 - Aims: We analyze the available information on the star BD+43 3654 to investigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB association Cygnus OB2. Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied. Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age. Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with our results.

Optical spectrum of the post-AGB star HD56126 in the region 4010-8790 AA - We studied in detail the optical spectrum of the post-AGB star HD56126 (IRAS07134+1005). We use high resolution spectra (R=25000 and 60000) obtained with the echelle spectrographs of the 6-m telescope. About one and a half thousand absorptions of neutral atoms and ions, absorption bands of C_2, CN, and CH molecules, and interstellar bands (DIBs) are identified in the 4010 to 8790 AA wavelength region, and the depths and radial velocities of these spectral features are measured. Differences are revealed between the variations of the radial velocities measured from spectral features of different excitation. In addition to the well-known variability of the Halpha profile, we found variations in the profiles of a number of FeII, YII, and BaII lines. We also produce an atlas of the spectrum of HD56126 and its comparison staralpha Per. The full version of the atlas is available in electronic form from Web-address: http://www.sao.ru/hq/ssl/Atlas/Atlas.html

Generation of Large Number-Path Entanglement Using Linear Optics and Feed-Forward - We show how an idealised measurement procedure can condense photons from two modes into one, and how, by feeding forward the results of the measurement, it is possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which only one mode is populated, commonly called ``N00N states''. For the basic procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead photons are detected at both ports, Schr\"{o}dinger cat states are produced. We describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include quantum imaging and metrology.

Finite branch solutions to Painleve VI around a fixed singular point - Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixed singular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution is an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally. The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces, resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic differential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify all finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.

An Inverse $f(R)$ Gravitation for Cosmic Speed up, and Dark Energy Equivalent - To explain the cosmic speed up, brought to light by the recent SNIa and CMB observations, we propose the following: a) In a spacetime endowed with a FRW metric, we choose an empirical scale factor that best explains the observations. b) We assume a modified gravity, generated by an unspecified field lagrangian, $f(R)$. c) We use the adopted empirical scale factor to work back retroactively to obtain $f(R)$, hence the term `Inverse $f(R)$'. d) Next we consider the classic GR and a conventional FRW universe that, in addition to its known baryonic content, possesses a hypothetical `Dark Energy' component. We compare the two scenarios, and find the density, the pressure, and the equation of the state of the Dark Energy required to make up for the differences between the conventional and the modified GR models.

Monitoring spatially heterogeneous dynamics in a drying colloidal thin film - We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten micrometers over the full field of view.

Mapping the circumstellar SiO maser emission in R Leo - The study of the innermost circumstellar layers around AGB stars is crucial to understand how these envelopes are formed and evolve. The SiO maser emission occurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct information on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical properties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the SiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine} the relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecond resolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiO v=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0 J=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in other oxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting regions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the central star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther shell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R Leo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of the different maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo.

Partially disordered state near ferromagnetic transition in MnSi - The polarized neutron scattering in helimagnetic MnSi at low $T$ reveals existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the magnetic field applied along $<111>$ axis below the first order transition to the non-chiral ferromagnetic state. This unexpected phenomenon is explained by the analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the spin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and $<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition between the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign means an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a destruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state below the first order ferromagnetic transition.

Fluctuations in glassy systems - We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrization invariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems. We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. We describe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be tested numerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explained by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal. We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d Edwards-Anderson spin-glass. Finally, we discuss up to which extent these ideas apply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up to present.

A generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and non rooted posets - In this paper we give a generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and using this we describe the M\"obius function of the generalized subword order from a poset {a1,...as,c |ai<c}, which contains an affirmative answer for the conjecture by Bj\"orner, Sagan, Vatter.[5,10]

Statistical analysis of weighted networks - The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization of weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters, namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient. Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted graphs.

Finite dimensionality of 2-D micropolar fluid flow with periodic boundary conditions - This paper is devoted to describe the finite-dimensionality of a two-dimensional micropolar fluid flow with periodic boundary conditions. We define the notions of determining modes and nodes and estimate the number of them, we also estimate the dimension of the global attractor. Finally we compare our results with analogous results for Navier-Stokes equation.

Strong Spherical Asymptotics for Rotor-Router Aggregation and the Divisible Sandpile - The rotor-router model is a deterministic analogue of random walk. It can be used to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We prove that the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which is stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\omega_d r^d$ sites, where $\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$, we show that the inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\log r)$, while the outradius is at most $r+O(r^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related model, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a Euclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total mass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\pi r^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\sqrt{3}$, and the outradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne and Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.

Study on Correlations between the Twin Kilohertz Quasi-periodic Oscillations in Low-mass X-ray Binaries - The recently updated data of the twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in the neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries are analyzed. The power-law fitting $\nu_{1}=a(\nu_{2}/1000)^{b}$ and linear fitting $\nu_{2}=A\nu_{1}+B$ are applied, individually, to the data points of four Z sources (GX 17+2, GX 340+0, GX 5-1 and Sco X-1) and four Atoll sources (4U 0614+09, 4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53 and 4U 1728-34). The $\chi^{2}$-tests show that the power-law correlation and linear correlation both can fit data well. Moreover, the comparisons between the data and the theoretical models for kHz QPOs are discussed.

Fuzzballs with internal excitations - We construct general 2-charge D1-D5 horizon-free non-singular solutions of IIB supergravity on T^4 and K3 describing fuzzballs with excitations in the internal manifold; these excitations are characterized by arbitrary curves. The solutions are obtained via dualities from F1-P solutions of heterotic and type IIB on T^4 for the K3 and T^4 cases, respectively. We compute the holographic data encoded in these solutions, and show that the internal excitations are captured by vevs of chiral primaries associated with the middle cohomology of T^4 or K3. We argue that each geometry is dual to a specific superposition of R ground states determined in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the curves defining the supergravity solution. We compute vevs of chiral primaries associated with the middle cohomology and show that they indeed acquire vevs in the superpositions corresponding to fuzzballs with internal excitations, in accordance with the holographic results. We also address the question of whether the fuzzball program can be implemented consistently within supergravity.

Birth, survival and death of languages by Monte Carlo simulation - Simulations of physicists for the competition between adult languages since 2003 are reviewed. How many languages are spoken by how many people? How many languages are contained in various language families? How do language similarities decay with geographical distance, and what effects do natural boundaries have? New simulations of bilinguality are given in an appendix.

Rigorous derivation of the mean field Green functions of the two-band Hubbard model of superconductivity - The Green function (GF) equation of motion technique for solving the effective two-band Hubbard model of high-T_c superconductivity in cuprates [N.M. Plakida et al., Phys. Rev. B, v. 51, 16599 (1995); JETP, v. 97, 331 (2003)] rests on the Hubbard operator (HO) algebra. We show that, if we take into account the invariance to translations and spin reversal, the HO algebra results in invariance properties of several specific correlation functions. The use of these properties allows rigorous derivation and simplification of the expressions of the frequency matrix (FM) and of the generalized mean field approximation (GMFA) Green functions (GFs) of the model. For the normal singlet hopping and anomalous exchange pairing correlation functions which enter the FM and GMFA-GFs, an approximation procedure based on the identification and elimination of exponentially small quantities is described. It secures the reduction of the correlation order to GMFA-GF expressions.

Geometry Effects at Atomic-Size Aluminium Contacts - We present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts. Addressing the neck of the contact, we compare characteristic geometries to investigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronic states. We find that the Al 3pz states are very sensitive against modifications of the orbital overlap, which has serious consequences for the transport properties. Stretching of the contact shifts states towards the Fermi energy, leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering. By spacial restriction, hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the charge neutrality is violated. We discuss the influence of mechanical stress by means of quantitative results for the charge transfer.

Current - voltage characteristics of break junctions of high-$T_c$ superconductors - The current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics of break junctions of polycrystalline La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$, Y$_{0.75}$Lu$_{0.25}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$, Bi$_{1.8}$Pb$_{0.3}$Sr$_{1.9}$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$ and composite YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ + Ag are investigated. The experimental $I$-$V$ curves exhibit the specific peculiarities of superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor junctions. The relation between an $I$-$V$ characteristic of network of weak links and $I$-$V$ dependencies of typical weak links is suggested to describe the experimental data. The $I$-$V$ curves of typical weak links are calculated by the K\"{u}mmel - Gunsenheimer - Nicolsky model considering the multiple Andreev reflections.

Photon splitting in a laser field - Photon splitting due to vacuum polarization in a laser field is considered. Using an operator technique, we derive the amplitudes for arbitrary strength, spectral content and polarization of the laser field. The case of a monochromatic circularly polarized laser field is studied in detail and the amplitudes are obtained as three-fold integrals. The asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes for various limits of interest are investigated also in the case of a linearly polarized laser field. Using the obtained results, the possibility of experimental observation of the process is discussed.

Phonon instability and structural phase transition in Vanadium under high pressure - Results of the first-principles calculations are presented for the group-VB metals V, Nb and Ta up to couple of megabar pressure. An unique structural phase transition sequence BCC-->(at 60 GPa) rhombohedral (angle=110.5 degree)-->(at ~ 160 GPa)rhombohedral(angle=108.5 degree)--> (at ~ 430 GPa) BCC is predicted in V. We also find that BCC-V becomes mechanically and vibrationally unstable at around 112 GPa pressure. Similar transitions are absent in Nb and Ta.

CP violation due to multi Froggatt-Nielsen fields - We study how to incorporate CP violation in the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN) mechanism. To this end, we introduce non-renormalizable interactions with a flavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is found that at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetry are necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative phase between their vacuum expectation values. In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are determined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation values R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how the angles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal elements |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| are predicted as a function of |V_{us}|, |R| and \alpha. Although the predicted value of the CP violating phase does not agree with the experimental data within the simplest model, the basic idea of our scenario would be promising to construct a more realistic model of flavor and CP violation.

Rigorous Results for the Periodic Oscillation of an Adiabatic Piston - We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The piston separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averaging techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $ when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation. When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly, both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing. In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging results. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem for smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.

Thermal decomposition of norbornane (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) dissolved in benzene. Experimental study and mechanism investigation - The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has been studied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, at residence times ranging from 1 to 4 s and at atmospheric pressure, leading to conversions from 0.04 to 22.6%. 25 reaction products were identified and quantified by gas chromatography, amongst which the main ones are hydrogen, ethylene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene. A mechanism investigation of the thermal decomposition of the norbornane - benzene binary mixture has been performed. Reactions involved in the mechanism have been reviewed: unimolecular initiations 1 by C-C bond scission of norbornane, fate of the generated diradicals, reactions of transfer and propagation of norbornyl radicals, reactions of benzene and cross-coupling reactions.

Detailed kinetic study of the ring opening of cycloalkanes by CBS-QB3 calculations - This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular decomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum chemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each cycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data (\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by means of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been included. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the 1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals. Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition state theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate constant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have been calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed to validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the rotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of importance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain energies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and show that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed upon the activation process.

On thermal effects in solid state lasers: the case of ytterbium-doped materials - A review of theoretical and experimental studies of thermal effects in solid-state lasers is presented, with a special focus on diode-pumped ytterbium-doped materials. A large part of this review provides however general information applicable to any kind of solid-state laser. Our aim here is not to make a list of the techniques that have been used to minimize thermal effects, but instead to give an overview of the theoretical aspects underneath, and give a state-of-the-art of the tools at the disposal of the laser scientist to measure thermal effects. After a presentation of some general properties of Yb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in Yb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the first step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III). We will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the thermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of thermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context where it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art of experimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing. Eventually, in part V, we will give some concrete examples in Yb-doped materials, where their peculiarities will be pointed out.

Dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowires - Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in nanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increase of diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings that the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature for diameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. The calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable in nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermal conductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the corresponding value in bulk materials.

Transient behavior of surface plasmon polaritons scattered at a subwavelength groove - We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field diffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces. The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient "near-zone" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally, it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part will be controlled by surface waves.

Entropic Measure and Wasserstein Diffusion - We construct a new random probability measure on the sphere and on the unit interval which in both cases has a Gibbs structure with the relative entropy functional as Hamiltonian. It satisfies a quasi-invariance formula with respect to the action of smooth diffeomorphism of the sphere and the interval respectively. The associated integration by parts formula is used to construct two classes of diffusion processes on probability measures (on the sphere or the unit interval) by Dirichlet form methods. The first one is closely related to Malliavin's Brownian motion on the homeomorphism group. The second one is a probability valued stochastic perturbation of the heat flow, whose intrinsic metric is the quadratic Wasserstein distance. It may be regarded as the canonical diffusion process on the Wasserstein space.

Second-Order Eikonal Corrections for A(e,e'p) - The first-order eikonal approximation is frequently adopted in interpreting the results of $A(e,e'p)$ measurements. Glauber calculations, for example, typically adopt the first-order eikonal approximation. We present an extension of the relativistic eikonal approach to $A(e,e'p)$ which accounts for second-order eikonal corrections. The numerical calculations are performed within the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nuclear transparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonal corrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2} \approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The same applies to polarization observables, left-right asymmetries, and differential cross sections at low missing momenta. At high missing momenta, however, the second-order eikonal corrections are significant and bring the calculations in closer agreement with the data and/or the exact results from models adopting partial-wave expansions.

AKARI Detection of the Infrared-Bright Supernova Remnant B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud - We present a serendipitous detection of the infrared-bright supernova remnant (SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four observed IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio, optical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative SNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared waveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the infrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible contributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged SNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443. Our results highlight the potential of AKARI IRC observations in studying SNRs, especially for diagnosing SNR shocks.

Flory-Huggins theory for the solubility of heterogeneously-modified polymers - Many water soluble polymers are chemically modified versions of insoluble base materials such as cellulose. A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determine the effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such polymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, with the effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme blockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a polymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for the synthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisation of such systems.

On second order shape optimization methods for electrical impedance tomography - This paper is devoted to the analysis of a second order method for recovering the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body $\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge, no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface $\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.

Braiding transformation, entanglement swapping and Berry phase in entanglement space - We show that braiding transformation is a natural approach to describe quantum entanglement, by using the unitary braiding operators to realize entanglement swapping and generate the GHZ states as well as the linear cluster states. A Hamiltonian is constructed from the unitary $\check{R}_{i,i+1}(\theta,\phi)$-matrix, where $\phi=\omega t$ is time-dependent while $\theta$ is time-independent. This in turn allows us to investigate the Berry phase in the entanglement space.

Photoproduction of pi0 omega off protons for E(gamma) < 3 GeV - Differential and total cross-sections for photoproduction of gamma proton to proton pi0 omega and gamma proton to Delta+ omega were determined from measurements of the CB-ELSA experiment, performed at the electron accelerator ELSA in Bonn. The measurements covered the photon energy range from the production threshold up to 3GeV.

Two-pion exchange three-nucleon potential: O(q^4) chiral expansion - We present the expansion of the two-pion exchange three-nucleon potential (TPE-3NP) to chiral order q^4, which corresponds to a subset of all possibilities at this order and is based on the \piN amplitude at O(q^3). Results encompass both numerical corrections to strength coefficients of previous O(q^3) terms and new structures in the profile functions. The former are typically smaller than 10% whereas the latter arise from either loop functions or non-local gradients acting on the wave function. The influence of the new TPE-3NP over static and scattering three-body observables has been assessed and found to be small, as expected from perturbative corrections.

Interference effects in above-threshold ionization from diatomic molecules: determining the internuclear separation - We calculate angle-resolved above-threshold ionization spectra for diatomic molecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-field approximation. The interference structure resulting from the individual contributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail, with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecular orientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes in which the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscure the interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes. However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has a classical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clear interference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able to infer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacent interference minima.

Neel order in the two-dimensional S=1/2 Heisenberg Model - The existence of Neel order in the S=1/2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice at T=0 is shown using inequalities set up by Kennedy, Lieb and Shastry in combination with high precision Quantum Monte Carlo data.

Maximum solutions of normalized Ricci flows on 4-manifolds - We consider maximum solution $g(t)$, $t\in [0, +\infty)$, to the normalized Ricci flow. Among other things, we prove that, if $(M, \omega) $ is a smooth compact symplectic 4-manifold such that $b_2^+(M)>1$ and let $g(t),t\in[0,\infty)$, be a solution to (1.3) on $M$ whose Ricci curvature satisfies that $|\text{Ric}(g(t))|\leq 3$ and additionally $\chi(M)=3 \tau (M)>0$, then there exists an $m\in \mathbb{N}$, and a sequence of points $\{x_{j,k}\in M\}$, $j=1, ..., m$, satisfying that, by passing to a subsequence, $$(M, g(t_{k}+t), x_{1,k},..., x_{m,k}) \stackrel{d_{GH}}\longrightarrow (\coprod_{j=1}^m N_j, g_{\infty}, x_{1,\infty}, ...,, x_{m,\infty}),$$ $t\in [0, \infty)$, in the $m$-pointed Gromov-Hausdorff sense for any sequence $t_{k}\longrightarrow \infty$, where $(N_{j}, g_{\infty})$, $j=1,..., m$, are complete complex hyperbolic orbifolds of complex dimension 2 with at most finitely many isolated orbifold points. Moreover, the convergence is $C^{\infty}$ in the non-singular part of $\coprod_1^m N_{j}$ and $\text{Vol}_{g_{0}}(M)=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\text{Vol}_{g_{\infty}}(N_{j})$, where $\chi(M)$ (resp. $\tau(M)$) is the Euler characteristic (resp. signature) of $M$.

Phase separation and flux quantization in the doped quantum dimer model on the square and triangular lattices - The doped two-dimensional quantum dimer model is investigated by numerical techniques on the square and triangular lattices, with significantly different results. On the square lattice, at small enough doping, there is always a phase separation between an insulating valence-bond solid and a uniform superfluid phase, whereas on the triangular lattice, doping leads directly to a uniform superfluid in a large portion of the RVB phase. Under an applied Aharonov-Bohm flux, the superfluid exhibits quantization in terms of half-flux quanta, consistent with Q=2e elementary charge quanta in transport properties.

Limit distributions and scaling functions - We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of models of lattice polygons, mainly on the square lattice. In particular, we focus on limiting area laws in the uniform perimeter ensemble where, for fixed perimeter, each polygon of a given area occurs with the same probability. We relate limit distributions to the scaling behaviour of the associated perimeter and area generating functions, thereby providing a geometric interpretation of scaling functions. To a major extent, this article is a pedagogic review of known results.

Incommmensurability and unconventional superconductor to insulator transition in the Hubbard model with bond-charge interaction - We determine the quantum phase diagram of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with bond-charge interaction X in addition to the usual Coulomb repulsion U at half-filling. For large enough X and positive U the model shows three phases. For large U the system is in the spin-density wave phase already known in the usual Hubbard model. As U decreases, there is first a spin transition to a spontaneously dimerized bond-ordered wave phase and then a charge transition to a novel phase in which the dominant correlations at large distances correspond to an incommensurate singlet superconductor.

Flavor Composition and Energy Spectrum of Astrophysical Neutrinos - The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the nature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamental properties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since a sufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is needed to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. In this work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and energy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment on the theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their structure.

Gravitational Wave Signals from Chaotic System: A Point Mass with A Disk - We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a point mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit, we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of the orbit via the gravitational waves.

$C^r$-Lohner algorithm - We present a Lohner type algorithm for the computation of rigorous bounds for solutions of ordinary differential equations and its derivatives with respect to initial conditions up to arbitrary order. As an application we prove the existence of multiple invariant tori around some elliptic periodic orbits for the pendulum equation with periodic forcing and for Michelson system.

Timing evidence in determining the accretion state of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3783 - Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have suggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope near zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black hole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between `hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies. Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

Two- and three-point Green's functions in two-dimensional Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory - The ghost and gluon propagator and the ghost-gluon and three-gluon vertex of two-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (minimal) Landau gauge are studied using lattice gauge theory. It is found that the results are qualitatively similar to the ones in three and four dimensions. The propagators and the Faddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario. In addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions are investigated systematically. The critical infrared exponents of the propagators, as proposed in calculations using stochastic quantization and Dyson-Schwinger equations, are confirmed quantitatively. For this purpose lattices of volume up to (42.7 fm)^2 have been used.

Coupled electron and phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions - Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we develop a fully quantum mechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions in the presence of a weak electron-phonon interaction. This model enables us to study the electronic and phononic transport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energy currents of the coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an application, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions within the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current conservation. We find that the inclusion of phonon transport is important in determining the heat dissipation and temperature change of the atomic junctions.

Observation of Spin-Orbit Berry's Phase in Magnetoresistance of a Two-Dimensional Hole Anti-dot System - We report observation of spin-orbit Berry's phase in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type oscillation of weak field magnetoresistance in an anti-dot lattice (ADL) of a two-dimensional hole system. An AB-type oscillation is superposed on the commensurability peak, and the main peak in the Fourier transform is clearly split up due to variation in Berry's phase originating from the spin-orbit interaction. A simulation considering Berry's phase and the phase arising from the spin-orbit shift in the momentum space shows qualitative agreement with the experiment.

On the dragging of light by a rotating medium - When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is rotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the transmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by extending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of the transmitted image.

Long-range correlation and multifractality in Bach's Inventions pitches - We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges (1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.

Circuit QED with a Flux Qubit Strongly Coupled to a Coplanar Transmission Line Resonator - We propose a scheme for circuit quantum electrodynamics with a superconducting flux-qubit coupled to a high-Q coplanar resonator. Assuming realistic circuit parameters we predict that it is possible to reach the strong coupling regime. Routes to metrological applications, such as single photon generation and quantum non-demolition measurements are discussed.

Zero bias anomaly out of equilibrium - The non-equilibrium zero bias anomaly (ZBA) in the tunneling density of states of a diffusive metallic film is studied. An effective action describing virtual fluctuations out-of-equilibrium is derived. The singular behavior of the equilibrium ZBA is smoothed out by real processes of inelastic scattering.

The First Law for Boosted Kaluza-Klein Black Holes - We study the thermodynamics of Kaluza-Klein black holes with momentum along the compact dimension, but vanishing angular momentum. These black holes are stationary, but non-rotating. We derive the first law for these spacetimes and find that the parameter conjugate to variations in the length of the compact direction is an effective tension, which generally differs from the ADM tension. For the boosted black string, this effective tension is always positive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also derive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance, and a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in the compact dimension. Finally, we show that the `tension first law' derived by Traschen and Fox in the static case has the form of a thermodynamic Gibbs-Duhem relation and give its extension in the stationary, non-rotating case.

Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance - The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router. Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria. In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss of monitoring detail.

The tensor part of the Skyrme energy density functional. I. Spherical nuclei - We perform a systematic study of the impact of the J^2 tensor term in the Skyrme energy functional on properties of spherical nuclei. In the Skyrme energy functional, the tensor terms originate both from zero-range central and tensor forces. We build a set of 36 parameterizations, which covers a wide range of the parameter space of the isoscalar and isovector tensor term coupling constants, with a fit protocol very similar to that of the successful SLy parameterizations. We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on a large variety of observables in spherical mean-field calculations, such as the spin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectra of doubly-magic nuclei, the evolution of spin-orbit splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei, mass residuals of spherical nuclei, and known anomalies of charge radii. Our main conclusion is that the currently used central and spin-orbit parts of the Skyrme energy density functional are not flexible enough to allow for the presence of large tensor terms.

Cosmological Singularities and a Conjectured Gravity/Coset Correspondence - We review the recently discovered connection between the Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like ``chaotic'' structure of generic cosmological singularities in eleven-dimensional supergravity and the ``last'' hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E(10). This intriguing connection suggests the existence of a hidden ``correspondence'' between supergravity (or even M-theory) and null geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional coset space K(E(10)). If true, this gravity/coset correspondence would offer a new view of the (quantum) fate of space (and matter) at cosmological singularities.

Acceleration and localization of matter in a ring trap - A toroidal trap combined with external time-dependent electric field can be used for implementing different dynamical regimes of matter waves. In particular, we show that dynamical and stochastic acceleration, localization and implementation of the Kapitza pendulum can be originated by means of proper choice of the external force.

GRO J1655-40: from ASCA and XMM-Newton Observations - We have analysed four ASCA observations (1994--1995, 1996--1997) and three XMM-Newton observations (2005) of this source, in all of which the source is in high/soft state. We modeled the continuum spectra with relativistic disk model kerrbb, estimated the spin of the central black hole, and constrained the spectral hardening factor f_col and the distance. If kerrbb model applies, for normally used value of f_col, the distance cannot be very small, and f_col changes with observations.

The HELLAS2XMM survey. X. The bolometric output of luminous obscured quasars: The Spitzer perspective - Aims: We aim at estimating the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the physical parameters related to the black holes harbored in eight high X-ray-to-optical (F_X/F_R>10) obscured quasars at z>0.9 selected in the 2--10 keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey. Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black holes residing in these AGN. Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron) bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the range ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is ~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994). For the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high stellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range (0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion phase.

$p$-Adic Haar multiresolution analysis - In this paper, the notion of {\em $p$-adic multiresolution analysis (MRA)} is introduced. We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a refinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$. The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different 2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be intensively used for applications.

Jumping Through Loops: On Soft Terms from Large Volume Compactifications - We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss further checks that need to be performed.

Driven activation versus thermal activation - Activated dynamics in a glassy system undergoing steady shear deformation is studied by numerical simulations. Our results show that the external driving force has a strong influence on the barrier crossing rate, even though the reaction coordinate is only weakly coupled to the nonequilibrium system. This "driven activation" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrhenius expression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined from the fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported by analytical results for a simplified model system.

Computation of Power Loss in Likelihood Ratio Tests for Probability Densities Extended by Lehmann Alternatives - We compute the loss of power in likelihood ratio tests when we test the original parameter of a probability density extended by the first Lehmann alternative.

Vertical dynamics of disk galaxies in MOND - We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circular velocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same disks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we construct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans equations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more realistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and Newtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.

Al'tshuler-Aronov correction to the conductivity of a large metallic square network - We consider the correction $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ due to electron-electron interaction to the conductivity of a weakly disordered metal (Al'tshuler-Aronov correction). The correction is related to the spectral determinant of the Laplace operator. The case of a large square metallic network is considered. The variation of $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}(L_T)$ as a function of the thermal length $L_T$ is found very similar to the variation of the weak localization $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{WL}(L_\phi)$ as a function of the phase coherence length. Our result for $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ interpolates between the known 1d and 2d results, but the interaction parameter entering the expression of $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ keeps a 1d behaviour. Quite surprisingly, the result is very close to the 2d logarithmic behaviour already for $L_T\sim{a}/2$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.

Magnetoconductance oscillations in metallic rings and decoherence due to electron-electron interaction - We study weak localization in chains of metallic rings. We show than nonlocality of quantum transport can drastically affect the behaviour of the harmonics of magnetoconductance oscillations. Two different geometries are considered: the case of rings separated by long wires compared to the phase coherence length and the case of contacted rings. In a second part we discuss the role of decoherence due to electron-electron interaction in these two geometries.

Diatomic molecule as a quantum entanglement switch - We investigate a pair entanglement of electrons in diatomic molecule, modeled as a correlated double quantum dot attached to the leads. The low-temperature properties are derived from the ground state obtained by utilizing the Rejec-Ramsak variational technique within the framework of EDABI method, which combines exact diagonalization with ab initio calculations. The results show, that single-particle basis renormalization modifies the entanglement-switch effectiveness significantly. We also found the entanglement signature of a competition between an extended Kondo and singlet phases.

Quantifying social group evolution - The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends, families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.

Weak and Strong Taylor methods for numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations - We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylor expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of the expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an easily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models, which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples underline the results.

Finite bias visibility of the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer - We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.

A note on higher-order differential operations - In this paper we consider successive iterations of the first-order differential operations in space ${\bf R}^3.$

Experimental Challenges Involved in Searches for Axion-Like Particles and Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamic Effects by Sensitive Optical Techniques - We discuss the experimental techniques used to date for measuring the changes in polarization state of a laser produced by a strong transverse magnetic field acting in a vacuum. We point out the likely artifacts that can arise in such experiments, with particular reference to the recent PVLAS observations and the previous findings of the BFRT collaboration. Our observations are based on studies with a photon-noise limited coherent homodyne interferometer with a polarization sensitivity of 2x10^-8 rad Hz^(1/2) mW^(-1/2).

Binary Systems as Test-beds of Gravity Theories - We review the general relativistic theory of the motion, and of the timing, of binary systems containing compact objects (neutron stars or black holes). Then we indicate the various ways one can use binary pulsar data to test the strong-field and/or radiative aspects of General Relativity, and of general classes of alternative theories of relativistic gravity.

Some combinatorial aspects of differential operation compositions on space $R^n$ - In this paper we present a recurrent relation for counting meaningful compositions of the higher-order differential operations on the space $R^{n}$ (n=3,4,...) and extract the non-trivial compositions of order higher than two.

Hyperbolicity in unbounded convex domains - We provide several equivalent characterizations of Kobayashi hyperbolicity in unbounded convex domains in terms of peak and anti-peak functions at infinity, affine lines, Bergman metric and iteration theory.

Actions for the Bosonic String with the Curved Worldsheet - At first we introduce an action for the string, which leads to a worldsheet that always is curved. For this action we study the Poincar\'e symmetry and the associated conserved currents. Then, a generalization of the above action, which contains an arbitrary function of the two-dimensional scalar curvature, will be introduced. An extra scalar field enables us to modify these actions to Weyl invariant models.

Bianchi Type I Massive String Magnetized Barotropic Perfect Fluid Cosmological Model in General Relativity - Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with magnetic field of barotropic perfect fluid distribution through the techniques used by Latelier and Stachel, is investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe, it is assumed that the universe is filled with barotropic perfect fluid distribution. The magnetic field is due to electric current produced along x-axis with infinite electrical conductivity. The behaviour of the model in presence and absence of magnetic field together with other physical aspects is further discussed.

General Relativity Today - After recalling the conceptual foundations and the basic structure of general relativity, we review some of its main modern developments (apart from cosmology) : (i) the post-Newtonian limit and weak-field tests in the solar system, (ii) strong gravitational fields and black holes, (iii) strong-field and radiative tests in binary pulsar observations, (iv) gravitational waves, (v) general relativity and quantum theory.

A procedure for finding the k-th power of a matrix - We give a new procedure in Maple for finding the k-th power of a martix. The algorithm is based on the article [1].

The dynamical Casimir effect in braneworlds - In braneworld cosmology the expanding Universe is realized as a brane moving through a warped higher-dimensional spacetime. Like a moving mirror causes the creation of photons out of vacuum fluctuations, a moving brane leads to graviton production. We show that, very generically, Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles scale like stiff matter with the expansion of the Universe and can therefore not represent the dark matter in a warped braneworld. We present results for the production of massless and KK gravitons for bouncing branes in five-dimensional anti de Sitter space. We find that for a realistic bounce the back reaction from the generated gravitons will be most likely relevant. This letter summarizes the main results and conclusions from numerical simulations which are presented in detail in a long paper [M.Ruser and R. Durrer, Phys. Rev. D 76, 104014 (2007), arXiv:0704.0790]

Bounds on Negativity of Superpositions - The entanglement quantified by negativity of pure bipartite superposed states is studied. We show that if the entanglement is quantified by the concurrence two pure states of high fidelity to one another still have nearly the same entanglement. Furthermore this conclusion can be guaranteed by our obtained inequality, and the concurrence is shown to be a continuous function even in infinite dimensions. The bounds on the negativity of superposed states in terms of those of the states being superposed are obtained. These bounds can find useful applications in estimating the amount of the entanglement of a given pure state.

Entangling Independent Photons by Time Measurement - A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be "swapped": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a "Bell-State Measurement", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

Energy conservation and Onsager's conjecture for the Euler equations - Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations for incompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal smoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate energy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for velocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this space is sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by local interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux; moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to $B^{2/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the strong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.

Search for Heavy, Long-Lived Particles that Decay to Photons at CDF II - We present the first search for heavy, long-lived particles that decay to photons at a hadron collider. We use a sample of photon+jet+missing transverse energy events in p-pbar collisions at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV taken with the CDF II detector. Candidate events are selected based on the arrival time of the photon at the detector. Using an integrated luminosity of 570 pb-1 of collision data, we observe 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3+-0.7 events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we set cross section limits in a supersymmetric model with \tilde{\chi}_1^0->\gamma\gravitino and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower limit on the \tilde{\chi}_1^0 mass of 101 GeV/c^2 at \tau_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} = 5 ns.

Failure of the work-Hamiltonian connection for free energy calculations - Extensions of statistical mechanics are routinely being used to infer free energies from the work performed over single-molecule nonequilibrium trajectories. A key element of this approach is the ubiquitous expression dW/dt=\partial H(x,t)/ \partial t which connects the microscopic work W performed by a time-dependent force on the coordinate x with the corresponding Hamiltonian H(x,t) at time t. Here we show that this connection, as pivotal as it is, cannot be used to estimate free energy changes. We discuss the implications of this result for single-molecule experiments and atomistic molecular simulations and point out possible avenues to overcome these limitations.

Dependence of the Critical Adsorption Point on Surface and Sequence Disorders for Self-Avoiding Walks Interacting with a Planar Surface - The critical adsorption point (CAP) of self-avoiding walks (SAW) interacting with a planar surface with surface disorder or sequence disorder has been studied. We present theoretical equations, based on ones previously developed by Soteros and Whittington (J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 2004, 37, R279-R325), that describe the dependence of CAP on the disorders along with Monte Carlo simulation data that are in agreement with the equations. We also show simulation results that deviate from the equations when the approximations used in the theory break down. Such knowledge is the first step toward understanding the correlation of surface disorder and sequence disorder during polymer adsorption.

Coherent control of atomic tunneling - We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential while the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the mechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of freedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom position, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. The effects described should be observable with atoms in an optical double well trap.

Correlation functions and excitation spectrum of the frustrated ferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain in an external magnetic field - Magnetic field effects on the one-dimensional frustrated ferromagnetic chain are studied by means of effective field theory approaches in combination with numerical calculations utilizing Lanczos diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group method. The nature of the ground state is shown to change from a spin-density-wave region to a nematic-like one upon approaching the saturation magnetization. The excitation spectrum is analyzed and the behavior of the single spin-flip excitation gap is studied in detail, including the emergent finite-size corrections.

Evidence of Spatially Inhomogeous Pairing on the Insulating Side of a Disorder-Tuned Superconductor-Insulator Transition - Measurements of transport properties of amorphous insulating indium oxide thin films have been interpreted as evidence of the presence of superconducting islands on the insulating side of a disorder-tuned superconductor-insulator transition. Although the films are not granular, the behavior is similar to that observed in granular films. The results support theoretical models in which the destruction of superconductivity by disorder produces spatially inhomogenous pairing with a spectral gap.

Local de Broglie-Bohm Trajectories from Entangled Wavefunctions - We present a local interpretation of what is usually considered to be a nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet state of massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term ``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e., the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without making any appeal to detector inefficiencies. We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories. We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a Stern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality loophole.

Ground-based Microlensing Surveys - Microlensing is a proven extrasolar planet search method that has already yielded the detection of four exoplanets. These detections have changed our understanding of planet formation ``beyond the snowline'' by demonstrating that Neptune-mass planets with separations of several AU are common. Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are generally inaccessible to other methods, in particular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very low-mass (i.e. terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets, and even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical constraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation of extrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-funded microlensing component. When combined with the results from other complementary surveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an accurate and complete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particular low-mass terrestrial planets.

The luminous infrared composite Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7679 through the [O III] 5007 emission line - NGC 7679 is a nearby luminous infrared Sy2 galaxy in which starburst and AGN activities co-exist. The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGN power-law continuum and starburst. The galaxy is a bright X-ray source possessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}. The Compton-thin nature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the Unified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this article is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the circumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1 nucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity. The [O III] 5007 image of the NGC 7679 shows elliptical isophotes extended along the PA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 7682. The maximum of ionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratio is displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. We conclude that the dust and gas in the high ionization direction has a direct view to the central AGN engine. This possibly results in dust/star-formation decay. A large fraction of the unabsorbed Compton-thin Sy2s with [O III] luminosity > 10^41 erg s^{-1} possesses a hidden AGN source (abridged).

The Fermionic Density-functional at Feshbach Resonance - We consider a dilute gas of neutral unpolarized fermionic atoms at zero temperature.The atoms interact via a short range (tunable) attractive interaction. We demonstrate analytically a curious property of the gas at unitarity. Namely, the correlation energy of the gas, evaluated by second order perturbation theory, has the same density dependence as the first order exchange energy, and the two almost exactly cancel each other at Feshbach resonance irrespective of the shape of the potential, provided $(\mu r_s) >> 1$. Here $(\mu)^{-1}$ is the range of the two-body potential, and $r_s$ is defined through the number density $n=3/(4\pi r_s^3)$. The implications of this result for universality is discussed.

Chemical Evolution - In this series of lectures we first describe the basic ingredients of galactic chemical evolution and discuss both analytical and numerical models. Then we compare model results for the Milky Way, Dwarf Irregulars, Quasars and the Intra-Cluster- Medium with abundances derived from emission lines. These comparisons allow us to put strong constraints on the stellar nucleosynthesis and the mechanisms of galaxy formation.

Suppression of 1/f noise in one-qubit systems - We investigate the generation of quantum operations for one-qubit systems under classical noise with 1/f^\alpha power spectrum, where 2>\alpha > 0. We present an efficient way to approximate the noise with a discrete multi-state Markovian fluctuator. With this method, the average temporal evolution of the qubit density matrix under 1/f^\alpha noise can be feasibly determined from recently derived deterministic master equations. We obtain qubit operations such as quantum memory and the NOT}gate to high fidelity by a gradient based optimization algorithm. For the NOT gate, the computed fidelities are qualitatively similar to those obtained earlier for random telegraph noise. In the case of quantum memory however, we observe a nonmonotonic dependency of the fidelity on the operation time, yielding a natural access rate of the memory.

Stability of a colocated finite volume scheme for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations - We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the velocity and pressure are both piecewise constant (colocated scheme). We use a projection (fractional-step) method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. We prove that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes equations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. In particular, we state an inf-sup (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. We infer from it the stability of the scheme.

Collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market - To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different markets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices. By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that, the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE. We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics with a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal structure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a signature of market development.

Galaxy morphologies and environment in the Abell 901/902 supercluster from COMBO-17 - We present a morphological study of galaxies in the A901/902 supercluster from the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription of Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes an intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies, supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed into S0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.

K_0-theory of n-potents in rings and algebras - Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. An \emph{$n$-potent} is an element $e$ of a ring $R$ such that $e^n = e$. In this paper, we study $n$-potents in matrices over $R$ and use them to construct an abelian group $K_0^n(R)$. If $A$ is a complex algebra, there is a group isomorphism $K_0^n(A) \cong \bigl(K_0(A)\bigr)^{n-1}$ for all $n \geq 2$. However, for algebras over cyclotomic fields, this is not true in general. We consider $K_0^n$ as a covariant functor, and show that it is also functorial for a generalization of homomorphism called an \emph{$n$-homomorphism}.

Spin coupling in zigzag Wigner crystals - We consider interacting electrons in a quantum wire in the case of a shallow confining potential and low electron density. In a certain range of densities, the electrons form a two-row (zigzag) Wigner crystal whose spin properties are determined by nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as by three- and four-particle ring exchange processes. The phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has regions of complete spin polarization and partial spin polarization in addition to a number of unpolarized phases, including antiferromagnetism and dimer order as well as a novel phase generated by the four-particle ring exchange.

Decoupling Supergravity from the Superstring - We consider the conditions necessary for obtaining perturbative maximal supergravity in d dimensions as a decoupling limit of type II superstring theory compactified on a (10 -- d)-torus. For dimensions d = 2 and d = 3 it is possible to define a limit in which the only finite-mass states are the 256 massless states of maximal supergravity. However, in dimensions d > 3 there are infinite towers of additional massless and finite-mass states. These correspond to Kaluza--Klein charges, wound strings, Kaluza--Klein monopoles or branes wrapping around cycles of the toroidal extra dimensions. We conclude that perturbative supergravity cannot be decoupled from string theory in dimensions d > 3. In particular, we conjecture that pure N = 8 supergravity in four dimensions is in the Swampland.

Frobenius splitting and geometry of $G$-Schubert varieties - Let $X$ be an equivariant embedding of a connected reductive group $G$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic. Let $B$ denote a Borel subgroup of $G$. A $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ is a subvariety of the form $\diag(G) \cdot V$, where $V$ is a $B \times B$-orbit closure in $X$. In the case where $X$ is the wonderful compactification of a group of adjoint type, the $G$-Schubert varieties are the closures of Lusztig's $G$-stable pieces. We prove that $X$ admits a Frobenius splitting which is compatible with all $G$-Schubert varieties. Moreover, when $X$ is smooth, projective and toroidal, then any $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ admits a stable Frobenius splitting along an ample divisors. Although this indicates that $G$-Schubert varieties have nice singularities we present an example of a non-normal $G$-Schubert variety in the wonderful compactification of a group of type $G_2$. Finally we also extend the Frobenius splitting results to the more general class of $\mathcal R$-Schubert varieties.

High Energy Variability Of Synchrotron-Self Compton Emitting Sources: Why One Zone Models Do Not Work And How We Can Fix It - With the anticipated launch of GLAST, the existing X-ray telescopes, and the enhanced capabilities of the new generation of TeV telescopes, developing tools for modeling the variability of high energy sources such as blazars is becoming a high priority. We point out the serious, innate problems one zone synchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. We then present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, time delayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account. By introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, our code can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situation typical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproduce variability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeV flares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.

Fusion of radioactive $^{132}$Sn with $^{64}$Ni - Evaporation residue and fission cross sections of radioactive $^{132}$Sn on $^{64}$Ni were measured near the Coulomb barrier. A large sub-barrier fusion enhancement was observed. Coupled-channel calculations including inelastic excitation of the projectile and target, and neutron transfer are in good agreement with the measured fusion excitation function. When the change in nuclear size and shift in barrier height are accounted for, there is no extra fusion enhancement in $^{132}$Sn+$^{64}$Ni with respect to stable Sn+$^{64}$Ni. A systematic comparison of evaporation residue cross sections for the fusion of even $^{112-124}$Sn and $^{132}$Sn with $^{64}$Ni is presented.

Tri-layer superlattices: A route to magnetoelectric multiferroics? - We explore computationally the formation of tri-layer superlattices as an alternative approach for combining ferroelectricity with magnetism to form magnetoelectric multiferroics. We find that the contribution to the superlattice polarization from tri-layering is small compared to typical polarizations in conventionalferroelectrics, and the switchable ferroelectric component is negligible. In contrast, we show that epitaxial strain and ``negative pressure'' can yield large, switchable polarizations that are compatible with the coexistence of magnetism, even in materials with no active ferroelectric ions.

Testing outer boundary treatments for the Einstein equations - Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using different boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution obtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and extracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution, thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial compactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here combines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.

Stability of a finite volume scheme for the incompressible fluids - We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the velocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use a projection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. We show that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes equations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. In particular we state an inf-sup (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. Using these properties we infer the stability of the scheme.

D-brane Instantons on the T^6/Z_3 orientifold - We give a detailed microscopic derivation of gauge and stringy instanton generated superpotentials for gauge theories living on D3-branes at Z_3-orientifold singularities. Gauge instantons are generated by D(-1)-branes and lead to Affleck, Dine and Seiberg (ADS) like superpotentials in the effective N=1 gauge theories with three generations of bifundamental and anti/symmetric matter. Stringy instanton effects are generated by Euclidean ED3-branes wrapping four-cycles on T^6/\Z_3. They give rise to Majorana masses in one case and non-renormalizable superpotentials for the other cases. Finally we determine the conditions under which ADS like superpotentials are generated in N=1 gauge theories with adjoints, fundamentals, symmetric and antisymmetric chiral matter.

Viscoplastic Properties and Tribological Behavior of Diamond-Like Carbon Films Using Nanoindentation and Nanoscratch Tests - Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films have been shown to demonstrate various tribological behaviors: in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), with either friction coefficients as low as 0.01 or less and very mild wear, or very high friction coefficients (>0.4) and drastic wear. These behaviors depend notably on gaseous environment, hydrogen content of the film [1], and on its viscoplastic properties [2,3]. A relation between superlow friction in UHV and viscoplasticity has indeed been established for a-C:H films and confirmed for a fluorinated sample (a-C:F:H). In this study, nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests were conducted in ambient air, using a nanoindentation apparatus, in order to evaluate tribological behaviors, as well as mechanical and viscoplastic properties of different amorphous carbon films.

Implication of the D^0 Width Difference On CP-Violation in D^0-\bar D^0 Mixing - Both BaBar and Belle have found evidence for a non-zero width difference in the $D^0$-$\bar D^0$ system. Although there is no direct experimental evidence for CP-violation in $D$ mixing (yet), we show that the measured values of the width difference $y\sim \Delta\Gamma$ already imply constraints on the CP-violating phase in $D$ mixing, which, if significantly different from zero, would be an unambiguous signal of new physics.

Convergence of a finite volume scheme for the incompressible fluids - We consider a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the velocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use a projection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. In a former paper, the stability of the scheme has been proven. We infer from it its convergence.

Optimal Synthesis of Multiple Algorithms - In this paper we give a definition of "algorithm," "finite algorithm," "equivalent algorithms," and what it means for a single algorithm to dominate a set of algorithms. We define a derived algorithm which may have a smaller mean execution time than any of its component algorithms. We give an explicit expression for the mean execution time (when it exists) of the derived algorithm. We give several illustrative examples of derived algorithms with two component algorithms. We include mean execution time solutions for two-algorithm processors whose joint density of execution times are of several general forms. For the case in which the joint density for a two-algorithm processor is a step function, we give a maximum-likelihood estimation scheme with which to analyze empirical processing time data.

New Close Binary Systems from the SDSS-I (Data Release Five) and the Search for Magnetic White Dwarfs in Cataclysmic Variable Progenitor Systems - We present the latest catalog of more than 1200 spectroscopically-selected close binary systems observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through Data Release Five. We use the catalog to search for magnetic white dwarfs in cataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% of cataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sample of close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmic variables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magnetic white dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed, would possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that are similar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the average field strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations of these systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic. Even if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magnetic white dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between the properties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and the presumed close binary progenitors.

Dynamical Casimir effect for gravitons in bouncing braneworlds - We consider a two-brane system in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. We study particle creation due to the motion of the physical brane which first approaches the second static brane (contraction) and then recedes from it(expansion). The spectrum and the energy density of the generated gravitons are calculated. We show that the massless gravitons have a blue spectrum and that their energy density satisfies the nucleosynthesis bound with very mild constraints on the parameters. We also show that the Kaluza-Klein modes cannot provide the dark matter in an anti-de-Sitter braneworld. However, for natural choices of parameters, backreaction from the Kaluza-Klein gravitons may well become important. The main findings of this work have been published in the form of a Letter [R. Durrer and M. Ruser, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 071601 (2007), arXiv:0704.0756].

Spectral analysis of Swift long GRBs with known redshift - We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite. Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2 parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties. The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest- frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a significant correlation between these two quantities (the "Amati" relation) and we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to -2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the "Amati" relation of non-Swift GRBs.

The Relationship Between Molecular Gas Tracers and Kennicutt-Schmidt Laws - We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density, depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al. hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

Friedmann Equations and Thermodynamics of Apparent Horizons - With the help of a masslike function which has dimension of energy and equals to the Misner-Sharp mass at the apparent horizon, we show that the first law of thermodynamics of the apparent horizon $dE=T_AdS_A$ can be derived from the Friedmann equation in various theories of gravity, including the Einstein, Lovelock, nonlinear, and scalar-tensor theories. This result strongly suggests that the relationship between the first law of thermodynamics of the apparent horizon and the Friedmann equation is not just a simple coincidence, but rather a more profound physical connection.

Constraints on the Interactions between Dark Matter and Baryons from the X-ray Quantum Calorimetry Experiment - Although the rocket-based X-ray Quantum Calorimetry (XQC) experiment was designed for X-ray spectroscopy, the minimal shielding of its calorimeters, its low atmospheric overburden, and its low-threshold detectors make it among the most sensitive instruments for detecting or constraining strong interactions between dark matter particles and baryons. We use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the precise limits the XQC experiment places on spin-independent interactions between dark matter and baryons, improving upon earlier analytical estimates. We find that the XQC experiment rules out a wide range of nucleon-scattering cross sections centered around one barn for dark matter particles with masses between 0.01 and 10^5 GeV. Our analysis also provides new constraints on cases where only a fraction of the dark matter strongly interacts with baryons.

Heavy-Light Semileptonic Decays in Staggered Chiral Perturbation Theory - We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory (\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4 for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered (and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially quenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when the light quarks are simulated with the staggered action.

A density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics: retrieving the noise - We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state, the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor. As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process Schr\"odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast stochastic Schr\"odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment behaves like the latter.

Scalar self-force on eccentric geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime: a time-domain computation - We calculate the self-force acting on a particle with scalar charge moving on a generic geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole. This calculation requires an accurate computation of the retarded scalar field produced by the moving charge; this is done numerically with the help of a fourth-order convergent finite-difference scheme formulated in the time domain. The calculation also requires a regularization procedure, because the retarded field is singular on the particle's world line; this is handled mode-by-mode via the mode-sum regularization scheme first introduced by Barack and Ori. This paper presents the numerical method, various numerical tests, and a sample of results for mildly eccentric orbits as well as ``zoom-whirl'' orbits.

Nonimmersions of RP^n implied by tmf, revisited - In a 2002 paper, the authors and Bruner used the new spectrum tmf to obtain some new nonimmersions of real projective spaces. In this note, we complete/correct two oversights in that paper. The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result was stated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yet it was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here we give a simple proof of those overlooked results. Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was claimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently that this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication by a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion results claimed in the original paper. Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*}(RP^\infty\times RP^\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\infty\times CP^\infty) in positive dimensions.

Spin Evolution of Accreting Neutron Stars: Nonlinear Development of the R-mode Instability - The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached, the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution. Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway (timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$. We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

Quantum Auctions - We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bids and distributed search to identify the winner(s). Measuring the final quantum state gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying the superposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can use entanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance that this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e., combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the quantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a suitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders to game the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather that computational constraints affect quantum algorithm choices.

Fundamental solutions for a class of non-elliptic homogeneous differential operators - We compute temperate fundamental solutions of homogeneous differential operators with real-principal type symbols. Via analytic continuation of meromorphic distributions, fundamental solutions for these non-elliptic operators can be constructed in terms of radial averages and invariant distributions on the unit sphere.

Hybrid-ARQ in Multihop Networks with Opportunistic Relay Selection - This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.

Geometric Phase and Superconducting Flux Quantization - In a ring of s-wave superconducting material the magnetic flux is quantized in units of $\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}$. It is well known from the theory of Josephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of d-wave material, then the flux is quantized in one-half of those units due to a additional phase shift of $\pi$. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of geometric phase. We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave and pure d-wave electron pairs. We find, for this idealized configuration, that the phase shift of $\pi$ follows from the discontinuity in the geometric phase and is thus a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics.

Equation-free implementation of statistical moment closures - We present a general numerical scheme for the practical implementation of statistical moment closures suitable for modeling complex, large-scale, nonlinear systems. Building on recently developed equation-free methods, this approach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of which may not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and may be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can in principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including strongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there may be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for implementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation.

Opportunistic Relay Selection with Limited Feedback - It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however, suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the importance of relay selection.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Catalog IV. Fifth Data Release - We present the fourth edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Catalog. The catalog contains 77,429 objects; this is an increase of over 30,000 entries since the previous edition. The catalog consists of the objects in the SDSS Fifth Data Release that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0 (in a cosmology with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7) have at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s, or have interesting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i=15.0, and have highly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the catalog is 5740 sq. deg. The quasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; the catalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are at redshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i < 19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio, near-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800--9200A at a spectral resolution of ~2000. The spectra can be retrieved from the public database using the information provided in the catalog. The average SDSS colors of quasars as a function of redshift, derived from the catalog entries, are presented in tabular form. Approximately 96% of the objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS.

Nuclear forces from chiral effective field theory - In this lecture series, I present the recent progress in our understanding of nuclear forces in terms of chiral effective field theory.

On a Conjecture of EM Stein on the Hilbert Transform on Vector Fields - Let $ v$ be a smooth vector field on the plane, that is a map from the plane to the unit circle. We study sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the Hilbert transform \operatorname H_{v, \epsilon}f(x) := \text{p.v.}\int_{-\epsilon}^ \epsilon f(x-yv(x)) \frac{dy}y where $ \epsilon $ is a suitably chosen parameter, determined by the smoothness properties of the vector field. It is a conjecture, due to E.\thinspace M.\thinspace Stein, that if $ v$ is Lipschitz, there is a positive $ \epsilon $ for which the transform above is bounded on $ L ^{2}$. Our principal result gives a sufficient condition in terms of the boundedness of a maximal function associated to $ v$. This sufficient condition is that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $ 1<p<2$. We show that the maximal function is bounded from $ L ^{2}$ to weak $ L ^{2}$ for all Lipschitz maximal function. The relationship between our results and other known sufficient conditions is explored.

Wide Field Surveys and Astronomical Discovery Space - I review the status of science with wide field surveys. For many decades surveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery, as we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an efficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address some problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide field surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the exciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way, the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field studying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then look briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA, PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all wavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended. I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be too expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the first is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and the second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.

The Cosmic Foreground Explorer (COFE): A balloon-borne microwave polarimeter to characterize polarized foregrounds - The COsmic Foreground Explorer (COFE) is a balloon-borne microwave polarime- ter designed to measure the low-frequency and low-l characteristics of dominant diffuse polarized foregrounds. Short duration balloon flights from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres will allow the telescope to cover up to 80% of the sky with an expected sensitivity per pixel better than 100 $\mu K / deg^2$ from 10 GHz to 20 GHz. This is an important effort toward characterizing the polarized foregrounds for future CMB experiments, in particular the ones that aim to detect primordial gravity wave signatures in the CMB polarization angular power spectrum.

Jet interactions in massive X-ray binaries - Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems, called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium. In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type of objects will be presented.

The Na I D resonance lines in main sequence late-type stars - We study the sodium D lines (D1: 5895.92 \AA; D2: 5889.95 \AA) in late-type dwarf stars. The stars have spectral types between F6 and M5.5 (B-V between 0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained medium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian observatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since 1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V) of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for the photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric activity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we find that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in flux stars of unknown colour.

Dynamics of Bose-Einstein Condensates - We report on some recent results concerning the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates, obtained in a series of joint papers with L. Erdos and H.-T. Yau. Starting from many body quantum dynamics, we present a rigorous derivation of a cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation known as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the time evolution of the condensate wave function.

Photons as quasi-charged particles - The Schrodinger motion of a charged quantum particle in an electromagnetic potential can be simulated by the paraxial dynamics of photons propagating through a spatially inhomogeneous medium. The inhomogeneity induces geometric effects that generate an artificial vector potential to which signal photons are coupled. This phenomenon can be implemented with slow light propagating through an a gas of double-Lambda atoms in an electromagnetically-induced transparency setting with spatially varied control fields. It can lead to a reduced dispersion of signal photons and a topological phase shift of Aharonov-Bohm type.

Exchange of quantum states between coupled oscillators - Exchange of quantum states between two interacting harmonic oscillator along their evolution time is discussed. It is analyzed the conditions for such exchange starting from a generic initial state and demonstrating that the effect occurs exactly only for the particular states C0|0>+Cn|N>, which includes the interesting qubits components |0>,|1>. It is also determined the relation between the coupling constant and characteristic frequencies of the oscillators to have the complete exchange.

3-D Simulations of Ergospheric Disk Driven Poynting Jets - This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole magnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux dominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the ergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified limit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the ergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for greatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux that is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of electromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux threading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading the equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central engine of powerful FRII quasars.

An S_3-symmetric Littlewood-Richardson rule - The classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients C(lambda,mu,nu) carry a natural $S_3$ symmetry via permutation of the indices. Our "carton rule" for computing these numbers transparently and uniformly explains these six symmetries; previously formulated Littlewood-Richardson rules manifest at most three of the six.

Two-scale structure of the electron dissipation region during collisionless magnetic reconnection - Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise, however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems, independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.

Position-Velocity Diagrams for the Maser Emission coming from a Keplerian Ring - We have studied the maser emission from a thin, planar, gaseous ring in Keplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorption coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with the distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q, these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed). Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the inner edge of the ring.

Coupling of whispering-gallery modes in size-mismatched microdisk photonic molecules - Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonic molecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical microresonators.

Spin solid phases of spin 1 and spin 3/2 antiferromagnets on a cubic lattice - We study spin S=1 and S=3/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a cubic lattice focusing on spin solid states. Using Schwinger boson formulation for spins, we start in a U(1) spin liquid phase proximate to Neel phase and explore possible confining paramagnetic phases as we transition away from the spin liquid by the process of monopole condensation. Electromagnetic duality is used to rewrite the theory in terms of monopoles. For spin 1 we find several candidate phases of which the most natural one is a phase with spins organized into parallel Haldane chains. For spin 3/2 we find that the most natural phase has spins organized into parallel ladders. As a by-product, we also write a Landau theory of the ordering in two special classical frustrated XY models on the cubic lattice, one of which is the fully frustrated XY model. In a particular limit our approach maps to a dimer model with 2S dimers coming out of every site, and we find the same spin solid phases in this regime as well.

Braided quantum field theories and their symmetries - Braided quantum field theories proposed by Oeckl can provide a framework for defining quantum field theories having Hopf algebra symmetries. In quantum field theories, symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlation functions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braided quantum field theories. We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopf algebra symmetries and braided quantum field theories, which are required for the relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to the Poincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One is the effective quantum field theory of three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other is noncommutative field theory on Moyal plane. We also comment on quantum field theory on kappa-Minkowski spacetime.

Chromospheric Flares - In this topical review I revisit the "chromospheric flare." This should currently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out the possiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone, but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways. It is the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular the visible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to the coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the chromosphere. The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents several difficult and interesting physical problems.

On the (3,N) Maurer-Cartan equation - Deformations of the 3-differential of 3-differential graded algebras are controlled by the (3,N) Maurer-Cartan equation. We find explicit formulae for the coefficients appearing in that equation, introduce new geometric examples of N-differential graded algebras, and use these results to study N Lie algebroids.

Electronic structure of kinetic energy driven superconductors in the presence of bilayer splitting - Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity, the electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state is studied. It is shown that the electron spectrum of bilayer cuprate superconductors is split into the bonding and antibonding components by the bilayer splitting, then the observed peak-dip-hump structure around the $[\pi,0]$ point is mainly caused by this bilayer splitting, with the superconducting peak being related to the antibonding component, and the hump being formed by the bonding component. The spectral weight increases with increasing the doping concentration. In analogy to the normal state case, both electron antibonding peak and bonding hump have the weak dispersions around the $[\pi,0]$ point.

9.7 micrometer Silicate Absorption in a Damped Lyman-alpha Absorber at z=0.52 - We report a detection of the 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption feature in a damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system at z_{abs} = 0.524 toward AO0235+164, using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The feature shows a broad shallow profile over about 8-12 micrometers in the absorber rest frame and appears to be > 15 sigma significant in equivalent width. The feature is fit reasonably well by the silicate absorption profiles for laboratory amorphous olivine or diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds. To our knowledge, this is the first indication of 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption in a DLA. We discuss potential implications of this finding for the nature of the dust in quasar absorbers. Although the feature is relatively shallow (tau_{9.7} = 0.08-0.09), it is about 2 times deeper than expected from extrapolation of the tau_{9.7} vs. E(B-V) relation known for diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds. Further studies of the 9.7 micrometer silicate feature in quasar absorbers will open a new window on the dust in distant galaxies.

Photometry of the Globular Cluster NGC 5466: Red Giants and Blue Stragglers - We present wide-field BVI photometry for about 11,500 stars in the low-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bump for the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected relative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence turnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the Yonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina models. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to main-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss theoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the inclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb interactions may be partly responsible. We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent and the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function, consistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue straggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or RGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at large distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that the stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density structure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually low central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of this, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the frequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.

Vortex Molecular Crystal and Vortex Plastic Crystal States in Honeycomb and Kagome Pinning Arrays - Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinning in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states "vortex molecular crystals" and "vortex plastic crystals" since they are similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems. We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that kagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical current above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.

Quark-Antiquark and Diquark Condensates in Vacuum in a 3D Two-Flavor Gross-Neveu Model - The effective potential analysis indicates that, in a 3D two-flavor Gross-Neveu model in vacuum, depending on less or bigger than the critical value 2/3 of $G_S/H_P$, where $G_S$ and $H_P$ are respectively the coupling constants of scalar quark-antiquark channel and pseudoscalar diquark channel, the system will have the ground state with pure diquark condensates or with pure quark-antiquark condensates, but no the one with coexistence of the two forms of condensates. The similarities and differences in the interplay between the quark-antiquark and the diquark condensates in vacuum in the 2D, 3D and 4D two-flavor four-fermion interaction models are summarized.

Spin accumulation from the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect - Recently, it has been shown that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the Dresselhaus type in $[110]$ quantum wells can be mathematically removed by a non-Abelian gauge transformation. In the presence of an additional uniform magnetic field, such a non-Abelian gauge flux leads to a spin accumulation at the edges of the sample, where the relative sign of the spin accumulation between the edges can be tuned by the sign of the Dresselhaus SOC constant. Our prediction can be tested by Kerr measurements within the available experimental sensitivities.

On packet lengths and overhead for random linear coding over the erasure channel - We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the performance gains offered by random network coding.

Terrestrial and Habitable Planet Formation in Binary and Multi-star Systems - One of the most surprising discoveries of extrasolar planets is the detection of planets in moderately close binary star systems. The Jovian-type planets in the two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefront questions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of the existence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. The diverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonder to what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied to binaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of the detection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies in binary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with the recent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection of more planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on the horizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial and habitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamental insights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategic impact on NASA science and missions.

Local well-posedness of nonlinear dispersive equations on modulation spaces - By using tools of time-frequency analysis, we obtain some improved local well-posedness results for the NLS, NLW and NLKG equations with Cauchy data in modulation spaces $M{p, 1}_{0,s}$.

P-adic arithmetic coding - A new incremental algorithm for data compression is presented. For a sequence of input symbols algorithm incrementally constructs a p-adic integer number as an output. Decoding process starts with less significant part of a p-adic integer and incrementally reconstructs a sequence of input symbols. Algorithm is based on certain features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm. p-adic coding algorithm may be considered as of generalization a popular compression technique - arithmetic coding algorithms. It is shown that for p = 2 the algorithm works as integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class of models it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm, for another special model and a specific alphabet it gives Golomb-Rice codes.

Compton X-ray and Gamma-ray Emission from Extended Radio Galaxies - The extended lobes of radio galaxies are examined as sources of X-ray and gamma-ray emission via inverse Compton scattering of 3K background photons. The Compton spectra of two exemplary examples, Fornax A and Centaurus A, are estimated using available radio measurements in the ~10's MHz - 10's GHz range. For average lobe magnetic fields of >~0.3-1 micro-G, the lobe spectra are predicted to extend into the soft gamma-rays making them likely detectable with the GLAST LAT. If detected, their large angular extents (~1 deg and 8 deg) will make it possible to ``image'' the radio lobes in gamma-rays. Similarly, this process operates in more distant radio galaxies and the possibility that such systems will be detected as unresolved gamma-ray sources with GLAST is briefly considered.

A matroid-friendly basis for the quasisymmetric functions - A new Z-basis for the space of quasisymmetric functions (QSym, for short) is presented. It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and several interesting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functions associated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, and Reiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the grading by matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that the morphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and that decomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrors the decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to the Hilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.

Bremsstrahlung Radiation At a Vacuum Bubble Wall - When charged particles collide with a vacuum bubble, they can radiate strong electromagnetic waves due to rapid deceleration. Owing to the energy loss of the particles by this bremsstrahlung radiation, there is a non-negligible damping pressure acting on the bubble wall even when thermal equilibrium is maintained. In the non-relativistic region, this pressure is proportional to the velocity of the wall and could have influenced the bubble dynamics in the early universe.

Universal Source Coding for Monotonic and Fast Decaying Monotonic Distributions - We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic distributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits, where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise, for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived. The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions. Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood description length may still be achievable.

Moduli spaces of rational tropical curves - This note is devoted to the definition of moduli spaces of rational tropical curves with n marked points. We show that this space has a structure of a smooth tropical variety of dimension n-3. We define the Deligne-Mumford compactification of this space and tropical $\psi$-class divisors.

Associated production of the charged Higgs boson and single top quark at the LHC - The left-right twin Higgs(LRTH) model predicts the existence of the charged Higgs $\phi^{\pm}$. In this paper, we study the production of the charged Higgs boson $\phi^{-}$ with single top quark via the process $bg\to t\phi^{-}$ at the $CERN$ Large Hadron Collider(LHC). The numerical results show that the production cross section can reach the level of $10 pb$ in the reasonable parameter space of the LRTH model. We expect that, as long as it is not too heavy, the possible signatures of the heavy charged Higgs boson $\phi^{-}$ might be detected via the decay mode $\phi^{-}\to \bar{t}b$ at the LHC experiments.

Difermion condensates in vacuum in 2-4D four-fermion interaction models - Theoretical analysis of interplay between the condensates $<\bar{q}q>$ and $<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the mean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$ color massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models, interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for 2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ are respectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\bar{q}q)$, a scalar $(qq)$ and a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, only pure $<\bar{q}q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is bigger than the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions entering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models will manifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D model, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates, besides the pure $<qq>$ condensate phase. The $G_S-H_S$ (or $G_S-H_P$) phase diagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a real constraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model.

Oscillation bands of condensates on a ring: Beyond the mean field theory - The Hamiltonian of a N-boson system confined on a ring with zero spin and repulsive interaction is diagonalized. The excitation of a pair of p-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuation of many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states can be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is studied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating from the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the appearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided into being collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relation between the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.

Kadowaki-Woods Ratio of Strongly Coupled Fermi Liquids - On the basis of the Fermi liquid theory, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio $A/\gamma^2$ is evaluated by using a first principle band calculation for typical itinerant $d$ and $f$ electron systems. It is found as observed that the ratio for the $d$ electron systems is significantly smaller than the normal $f$ systems, even without considering their relatively weak correlation. The difference in the ratio value comes from different characters of the Fermi surfaces. By comparing Pd and USn$_3$ as typical cases, we discuss the importance of the Fermi surface dependence of the quasiparticle transport relaxation.

Structure of Strange Dwarfs with Color Superconducting Core - We study effects of two-flavor color superconductivity on the structure of strange dwarfs, which are stellar objects with similar masses and radii with ordinary white dwarfs but stabilized by the strange quark matter core. We find that unpaired quark matter is a good approximation to the core of strange dwarfs.

Information entropic superconducting microcooler - We consider a design for a cyclic microrefrigerator using a superconducting flux qubit. Adiabatic modulation of the flux combined with thermalization can be used to transfer energy from a lower temperature normal metal thin film resistor to another one at higher temperature. The frequency selectivity of photonic heat conduction is achieved by including the hot resistor as part of a high frequency LC resonator and the cold one as part of a low-frequency oscillator while keeping both circuits in the underdamped regime. We discuss the performance of the device in an experimentally realistic setting. This device illustrates the complementarity of information and thermodynamic entropy as the erasure of the quantum bit directly relates to the cooling of the resistor.

PI degree parity in q-skew polynomial rings - For k a field of arbitrary characteristic, and R a k-algebra, we show that the PI degree of an iterated skew polynomial ring R[x_1;\tau_1,\delta_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n,\delta_n] agrees with the PI degree of R[x_1;\tau_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n] when each (\tau_i,\delta_i) satisfies a q_i-skew relation for q_i \in k^{\times} and extends to a higher q_i-skew \tau_i-derivation. We confirm the quantum Gel'fand-Kirillov conjecture for various quantized coordinate rings, and calculate their PI degrees. We extend these results to completely prime factor algebras.

Semi-spheroidal Quantum Harmonic Oscillator - A new single-particle shell model is derived by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for a semi-spheroidal potential well. Only the negative parity states of the $Z(z)$ component of the wave function are allowed, so that new magic numbers are obtained for oblate semi-spheroids, semi-sphere and prolate semi-spheroids. The semi-spherical magic numbers are identical with those obtained at the oblate spheroidal superdeformed shape: 2, 6, 14, 26, 44, 68, 100, 140, ... The superdeformed prolate magic numbers of the semi-spheroidal shape are identical with those obtained at the spherical shape of the spheroidal harmonic oscillator: 2, 8, 20, 40, 70, 112, 168 ...

Growing Perfect Decagonal Quasicrystals by Local Rules - A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D, contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.

LRS Bianchi Type-V Viscous Fluid Universe With a Time Dependent Cosmological Term $\Lambda$ - An LRS Bianchi type-V cosmological models representing a viscous fluid distribution with a time dependent cosmological term $\Lambda$ is investigated. To get a determinate solution, the viscosity coefficient of bulk viscous fluid is assumed to be a power function of mass density. It turns out that the cosmological term $\Lambda(t)$ is a decreasing function of time, which is consistent with recent observations of type Ia supernovae. Various physical and kinematic features of these models have also been explored.

Density matrix elements and entanglement entropy for the spin-1/2 XXZ chain at $\Delta$=1/2 - We have analytically obtained all the density matrix elements up to six lattice sites for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain at $\Delta=1/2$. We use the multiple integral formula of the correlation function for the massless XXZ chain derived by Jimbo and Miwa. As for the spin-spin correlation functions, we have newly obtained the fourth- and fifth-neighbour transverse correlation functions. We have calculated all the eigenvalues of the density matrix and analyze the eigenvalue-distribution. Using these results the exact values of the entanglement entropy for the reduced density matrix up six lattice sites have been obtained. We observe that our exact results agree quite well with the asymptotic formula predicted by the conformal field theory.

Counting on rectangular areas - In the first section of this paper we prove a theorem for the number of columns of a rectangular area that are identical to the given one. In the next section we apply this theorem to derive several combinatorial identities by counting specified subsets of a finite set.

Bose-Einstein correlations of direct photons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV - The current status of the analysis of direct photon Bose-Einstein correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV done by the PHENIX collaboration is summarized. All possible sources of distortion of the two-photon correlation function are discussed and methods to control them in the PHENIX experiment are presented.

Normalized Ricci flow on nonparabolic surfaces - This paper studies normalized Ricci flow on a nonparabolic surface, whose scalar curvature is asymptotically -1 in an integral sense. By a method initiated by R. Hamilton, the flow is shown to converge to a metric of constant scalar curvature -1. A relative estimate of Green's function is proved as a tool.

Polarization properties of subwavelength hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes - Influence of hole shape on extraordinary optical transmission was investigated using hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes with different aspect ratio. It was found that the transmission could be tuned continuously by rotating the hole array. Further more, a phase was generated in this process, and linear polarization states could be changed to elliptical polarization states. This phase was correlated with the aspect ratio of the holes. An intuitional model was presented to explain these results.

Three dimensional cooling and trapping with a narrow line - The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in laser cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a magneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of the loading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to a simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal directions. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation where cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.

Approximate Selection Rule for Orbital Angular Momentum in Atomic Radiative Transitions - We demonstrate that radiative transitions with \Delta l = - 1 are strongly dominating for all values of n and l, except small region where l << n.

Extrasolar scale change in Newton's Law from 5D `plain' R^2-gravity - Galactic rotation curves and lack of direct observations of Dark Matter may indicate that General Relativity is not valid (on galactic scale) and should be replaced with another theory. There is the only variant of Absolute Parallelism which solutions are free of arising singularities, if D=5 (there is no room for changes). This variant does not have a Lagrangian, nor match GR: an equation of `plain' R^2-gravity (ie without R-term) is in sight instead. Arranging an expanding O_4-symmetrical solution as the basis of 5D cosmological model, and probing a universal_function of mass distribution (along very-very long the extra dimension) to place into bi-Laplace equation (R^2 gravity), one can derive the Law of Gravitation: 1/r^2 transforms to 1/r with distance (not with acceleration).

Lessons Learned from the deployment of a high-interaction honeypot - This paper presents an experimental study and the lessons learned from the observation of the attackers when logged on a compromised machine. The results are based on a six months period during which a controlled experiment has been run with a high interaction honeypot. We correlate our findings with those obtained with a worldwide distributed system of lowinteraction honeypots.

Transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant and energy on locally compact spaces - We study the relationship between transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant and Wiener energy in the abstract linear potential analytic setting pioneered by Choquet, Fuglede and Ohtsuka. It turns out that, whenever the potential theoretic kernel has the maximum principle, then all these quantities are equal for all compact sets. For continuous kernels even the converse statement is true: if the Chebyshev constant of any compact set coincides with its transfinite diameter, the kernel must satisfy the maximum principle. An abundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.

Availability assessment of SunOS/Solaris Unix Systems based on Syslogd and wtmpx logfiles : a case study - This paper presents a measurement-based availability assessment study using field data collected during a 4-year period from 373 SunOS/Solaris Unix workstations and servers interconnected through a local area network. We focus on the estimation of machine uptimes, downtimes and availability based on the identification of failures that caused total service loss. Data corresponds to syslogd event logs that contain a large amount of information about the normal activity of the studied systems as well as their behavior in the presence of failures. It is widely recognized that the information contained in such event logs might be incomplete or imperfect. The solution investigated in this paper to address this problem is based on the use of auxiliary sources of data obtained from wtmpx files maintained by the SunOS/Solaris Unix operating system. The results obtained suggest that the combined use of wtmpx and syslogd log files provides more complete information on the state of the target systems that is useful to provide availability estimations that better reflect reality.

Empirical analysis and statistical modeling of attack processes based on honeypots - Honeypots are more and more used to collect data on malicious activities on the Internet and to better understand the strategies and techniques used by attackers to compromise target systems. Analysis and modeling methodologies are needed to support the characterization of attack processes based on the data collected from the honeypots. This paper presents some empirical analyses based on the data collected from the Leurr{\'e}.com honeypot platforms deployed on the Internet and presents some preliminary modeling studies aimed at fulfilling such objectives.

The Low CO Content of the Extremely Metal Poor Galaxy I Zw 18 - We present sensitive molecular line observations of the metal-poor blue compact dwarf I Zw 18 obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. These data constrain the CO J=1-0 luminosity within our 300 pc (FWHM) beam to be L_CO < 1 \times 10^5 K km s^-1 pc^2 (I_CO < 1 K km s^-1), an order of magnitude lower than previous limits. Although I Zw 18 is starbursting, it has a CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC 1569, the SMC, and NGC 6822). There is less CO in I Zw 18 relative to its B-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarf starburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing the star formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gas forms stars much more efficiently in I Zw 18 than in our own galaxy, it must have a very low CO-to-H_2 ratio, \sim 10^-2 times the Galactic value. We detect 3mm continuum emission, presumably due to thermal dust and free-free emission, towards the radio peak.

A binary model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies (MNRAS version) - The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.

Redshifts of the Long Gamma-Ray Bursts - The low energy spectra of some gamma-ray bursts' show excess components beside the power-law dependence. The consequences of such a feature allows to estimate the gamma photometric redshift of the long gamma-ray bursts in the BATSE Catalog. There is good correlation between the measured optical and the estimated gamma photometric redshifts. The estimated redshift values for the long bright gamma-ray bursts are up to z=4, while for the the faint long bursts - which should be up to z=20 - the redshifts cannot be determined unambiguously with this method. The redshift distribution of all the gamma-ray bursts with known optical redshift agrees quite well with the BATSE based gamma photometric redshift distribution.

An architecture-based dependability modeling framework using AADL - For efficiency reasons, the software system designers' will is to use an integrated set of methods and tools to describe specifications and designs, and also to perform analyses such as dependability, schedulability and performance. AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) has proved to be efficient for software architecture modeling. In addition, AADL was designed to accommodate several types of analyses. This paper presents an iterative dependency-driven approach for dependability modeling using AADL. It is illustrated on a small example. This approach is part of a complete framework that allows the generation of dependability analysis and evaluation models from AADL models to support the analysis of software and system architectures, in critical application domains.

A priori estimates for weak solutions of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations - Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold and $\om$ a smooth closed form of bidegree $(1,1)$ which is nonnegative and big. We study the classes ${\mathcal E}_{\chi}(X,\om)$ of $\om$-plurisubharmonic functions of finite weighted Monge-Amp\`ere energy. When the weight $\chi$ has fast growth at infinity, the corresponding functions are close to be bounded. We show that if a positive Radon measure is suitably dominated by the Monge-Amp\`ere capacity, then it belongs to the range of the Monge-Amp\`ere operator on some class ${\mathcal E}_{\chi}(X,\om)$. This is done by establishing a priori estimates on the capacity of sublevel sets of the solutions. Our result extends U.Cegrell's and S.Kolodziej's results and puts them into a unifying frame. It also gives a simple proof of S.T.Yau's celebrated a priori ${\mathcal C}^0$-estimate.

Density oscillation in highly flattened quantum elliptic rings and tunable strong dipole radiation - A narrow elliptic ring containing an electron threaded by a magnetic field B is studied. When the ring is highly flattened, the increase of B would lead to a big energy gap between the ground and excited states, and therefore lead to a strong emission of dipole photons. The photon frequency can be tuned in a wide range by changing B and/or the shape of the ellipse. The particle density is found to oscillate from a pattern of distribution to another pattern back and forth against $B$. This is a new kind of Aharonov-Bohm oscillation originating from symmetry breaking and is different from the usual oscillation of persistent current.

Effect of electron-electron interaction on the phonon-mediated spin relaxation in quantum dots - We estimate the spin relaxation rate due to spin-orbit coupling and acoustic phonon scattering in weakly-confined quantum dots with up to five interacting electrons. The Full Configuration Interaction approach is used to account for the inter-electron repulsion, and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings are exactly diagonalized. We show that electron-electron interaction strongly affects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation rates strongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the mechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2) quantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, we discuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject to external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the experimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin relaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon emission.

Connected Operators for the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process - We fully elucidate the structure of the hierarchy of the connected operators that commute with the Markov matrix of the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process (TASEP). We prove for the connected operators a combinatorial formula that was conjectured in a previous work. Our derivation is purely algebraic and relies on the algebra generated by the local jump operators involved in the TASEP. Keywords: Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics, ASEP, Exact Results, Algebraic Bethe Ansatz.

Proposal for an Enhanced Optical Cooling System Test in an Electron Storage Ring - We are proposing to test experimentally the new idea of Enhanced Optical Cooling (EOC) in an electron storage ring. This experiment will confirm new fundamental processes in beam physics and will demonstrate new unique possibilities with this cooling technique. It will open important applications of EOC in nuclear physics, elementary particle physics and in Light Sources (LS) based on high brightness electron and ion beams.

The IDV source J1128+5925, a new candidate for annual modulation? - Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources, known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and 10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The latter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.

Spectral perturbation bounds for selfadjoint operators - We give general spectral and eigenvalue perturbation bounds for a selfadjoint operator perturbed in the sense of the pseudo-Friedrichs extension. We also give several generalisations of the aforementioned extension. The spectral bounds for finite eigenvalues are obtained by using analyticity and monotonicity properties (rather than variational principles) and they are general enough to include eigenvalues in gaps of the essential spectrum.

Predicting the frequencies of diverse exo-planetary systems - Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass exo-planets.

Higher ramification and varieties of secant divisors on the generic curve - For a smooth projective curve, the cycles of e-secant k-planes are among the most studied objects in classical enumerative geometry and there are well-known formulas due to Castelnuovo, Cayley and MacDonald concerning them. Despite various attempts, surprisingly little is known about the enumerative validity of such formulas. The aim of this paper is to completely clarify this problem in the case of the generic curve C of given genus. Using degeneration techniques and a few facts about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of stable pointed curves we determine precisely under which conditions the cycle of e-secant k-planes in non-empty and we compute its dimension. We also precisely determine the dimension of the variety of linear series on C carrying e-secant k-planes. In a different direction, in the last part of the paper we study the distribution of ramification points of the powers of a line bundle on C having prescribed ramification at a given point.

The concrete theory of numbers: initial numbers and wonderful properties of numbers repunit - In this work initial numbers and repunit numbers have been studied. All numbers have been considered in a decimal notation. The problem of simplicity of initial numbers has been studied. Interesting properties of numbers repunit are proved: $gcd(R_a, R_b) = R_{gcd(a,b)}$; $R_{ab}/(R_aR_b)$ is an integer only if $gcd(a,b) = 1$, where $a\geq1$, $b\geq1$ are integers. Dividers of numbers repunit, are researched by a degree of prime number.

Non-monotone convergence in the quadratic Wasserstein distance - We give an easy counter-example to Problem 7.20 from C. Villani's book on mass transport: in general, the quadratic Wasserstein distance between $n$-fold normalized convolutions of two given measures fails to decrease monotonically.

The bimodality of type Ia Supernovae - We comment on the presence of a bimodality in the distribution of delay time between the formation of the progenitors and their explosion as type Ia SNe. Two "flavors" of such bimodality are present in the literature: a "weak" bimodality, in which type Ia SNe must explode from both young and old progenitors, and a "strong" bimodality, in which about half of the systems explode within 10^8 years from formation. The "weak" bimodality is observationally based on the dependence of the rates with the host galaxy SFR, while the "strong" one on the different rates in radio-loud and radio-quiet early-type galaxies. We review the evidence for these bimodalities. Finally, we estimate the fraction of SNe which are missed by optical and near-IR searches because of dust extinction in massive starbursts.

Structural relaxation around substitutional Cr3+ in MgAl2O4 - The structural environment of substitutional Cr3+ ion in MgAl2O4 spinel has been investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies. First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANES spectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-O distance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first neighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These observations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4 solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three four-fold axes of the cubic structure.

A Hierarchical Approach for Dependability Analysis of a Commercial Cache-Based RAID Storage Architecture - We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysis and evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storage system. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of overlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels have been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and error detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors oc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the hierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The models have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for system-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject faults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and recovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault models are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk failures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the disks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given submodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the lower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and analyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate (focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms implemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the accumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.

Stochastic action principle and maximum entropy - A stochastic action principle for stochastic dynamics is revisited. We present first numerical diffusion experiments showing that the diffusion path probability depend exponentially on average Lagrangian action. This result is then used to derive an uncertainty measure defined in a way mimicking the heat or entropy in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the path uncertainty (or path entropy) can be measured by the Shannon information and that the maximum entropy principle and the least action principle of classical mechanics can be unified into a concise form. It is argued that this action principle, hence the maximum entropy principle, is simply a consequence of the mechanical equilibrium condition extended to the case of stochastic dynamics.

Constraining the Dark Energy Equation of State with Cosmic Voids - Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energy with negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key to understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like bubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the background cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the matter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h), we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may be a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss the parameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.

A Dark Energy model combining DGP gravity and Chaplygin gas - The expansion of the Universe is accelerating, as testified by observations of supernovae of type Ia as a function of redshift. Explanations are of two types: modifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy, coined dark energy.The accelerated expansion is explained here by a combination of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model gravity and Chaplygin gas dark energy. Both models are characterized by a length scale L which may be the same. The continuity equation for the combined model is derived in flat geometry, and solved by numerical methods. The solution is shown to have the expected properties: at very small scales (a<<L) the energy density behaves as pressureless dust, at very large scales (a>>L) as a cosmological constant. The modifications to the DGP model and the Chaplygin gas model occur for values of a L. The results show an increase in the present dark energy density relative to the plain DGP model.

Gauge-Higgs Unification and LHC/ILC - In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario the 4D Higgs field is identified with the zero mode of the extra-dimensional component of gauge potentials. The mass of the Higgs particle in the unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime is predicted to be in the range 100 GeV - 300 GeV. The WWZ gauge couplings remains almost universal as in the standard model, but substantial deviation results for the Higgs couplings. The WWH and ZZH couplings are suppressed by a factor \cos \theta_H from the values in the standard model, where \theta_H is the Yang-Mills AB phase along the fifth dimension. These can be tested at LHC and ILC.

Extension theorems of Sakai type for separately holomorphic and meromorphic functions - We first exhibit counterexamples to some open questions related to a theorem of Sakai. Then we establish an extension theorem of Sakai type for separately holomorphic/meromorphic functions.

Uniform measures and countably additive measures - Uniform measures are defined as the functionals on the space of bounded uniformly continuous functions that are continuous on bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets. If every cardinal has measure zero then every countably additive measure is a uniform measure. The functionals sequentially continuous on bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets are exactly uniform measures on the separable modification of the underlying uniform space.

Lower bounds for the conductivities of correlated quantum systems - We show how one can obtain a lower bound for the electrical, spin or heat conductivity of correlated quantum systems described by Hamiltonians of the form H = H0 + g H1. Here H0 is an interacting Hamiltonian characterized by conservation laws which lead to an infinite conductivity for g=0. The small perturbation g H1, however, renders the conductivity finite at finite temperatures. For example, H0 could be a continuum field theory, where momentum is conserved, or an integrable one-dimensional model while H1 might describe the effects of weak disorder. In the limit g to 0, we derive lower bounds for the relevant conductivities and show how they can be improved systematically using the memory matrix formalism. Furthermore, we discuss various applications and investigate under what conditions our lower bound may become exact.

Non-extensive thermodynamics of 1D systems with long-range interaction - A new approach to non-extensive thermodynamical systems with non-additive energy and entropy is proposed. The main idea of the paper is based on the statistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additive multi-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spin chain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptotical expressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for the limiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are found to be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).

NMR evidence for a strong modulation of the Bose-Einstein Condensate in BaCuSi$_2$O$_6$ - We present a $^{63,65}$Cu and $^{29}$Si NMR study of the quasi-2D coupled spin 1/2 dimer compound BaCuSi$_2$O$_6$ in the magnetic field range 13-26 T and at temperatures as low as 50 mK. NMR data in the gapped phase reveal that below 90 K different intra-dimer exchange couplings and different gaps ($\Delta_{\rm{B}}/\Delta_{\rm{A}}$ = 1.16) exist in every second plane along the c-axis, in addition to a planar incommensurate (IC) modulation. $^{29}$Si spectra in the field induced magnetic ordered phase reveal that close to the quantum critical point at $H_{\rm{c1}}$ = 23.35 T the average boson density $\bar{n}$ of the Bose-Einstein condensate is strongly modulated along the c-axis with a density ratio for every second plane $\bar{n}_{\rm{A}}/\bar{n}_{\rm{B}} \simeq 5$. An IC modulation of the local density is also present in each plane. This adds new constraints for the understanding of the 2D value $\phi$ = 1 of the critical exponent describing the phase boundary.

Bibliometric statistical properties of the 100 largest European universities: prevalent scaling rules in the science system - For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statistical properties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field citation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations. In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance universities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations with increasing research performance, average field citation density, and average journal impact.

On the Origin of Asymmetries in Bilateral Supernova Remnants - AIMS: We investigate whether the morphology of bilateral supernova remnants (BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field. METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1) through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2) through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission, making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of relativistic electrons. RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models and observations. CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

Reactor Monitoring with Neutrinos - The fundamental knowledge on neutrinos acquired in the recent years open the possibility of applied neutrino physics. Among it the automatic and non intrusive monitoring of nuclear reactor by its antineutrino signal could be very valuable to IAEA in charge of the control of nuclear power plants. Several efforts worldwide have already started.

Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks - Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted, and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the unsynchronizable state.

Topological phase for spin-orbit transformations on a laser beam - We investigate the topological phase associated with the double connectedness of the SO(3) representation in terms of maximally entangled states. An experimental demonstration is provided in the context of polarization and spatial mode transformations of a laser beam carrying orbital angular momentum. The topological phase is evidenced through interferometric measurements and a quantitative relationship between the concurrence and the fringes visibility is derived. Both the quantum and the classical regimes were investigated.

The Solar Neighborhood. XIX. Discovery and Characterization of 33 New Nearby White Dwarf Systems - We present spectra for 33 previously unclassified white dwarf systems brighter than V = 17 primarily in the southern hemisphere. Of these new systems, 26 are DA, 4 are DC, 2 are DZ, and 1 is DQ. We suspect three of these systems are unresolved double degenerates. We obtained VRI photometry for these 33 objects as well as for 23 known white dwarf systems without trigonometric parallaxes, also primarily in the southern hemisphere. For the 56 objects, we converted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy distribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure hydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of effective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are estimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons of 25 pc, constituting a potential 18% increase in the nearby white dwarf sample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are underway via CTIOPI for these 20 systems. One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared. Using the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able to constrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object is most likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool white dwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared due to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.

Gorenstein locus of minuscule Schubert varieties - In this article, we describe explicitely the Gorenstein locus of all minuscule Schubert varieties. This proves a special case of a conjecture of A. Woo and A. Yong (see math.AG/0603273) on the Gorenstein locus of Schubert varieties.

Model C critical dynamics of random anisotropy magnets - We study the relaxational critical dynamics of the three-dimensional random anisotropy magnets with the non-conserved n-component order parameter coupled to a conserved scalar density. In the random anisotropy magnets the structural disorder is present in a form of local quenched anisotropy axes of random orientation. When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edges of the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical properties coincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disorder gives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We investigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group analysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtain quantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents of the order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenarios for the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.

A unified approach to the theory of separately holomorphic mappings - We extend the theory of separately holomorphic mappings between complex analytic spaces. Our method is based on Poletsky theory of discs, Rosay Theorem on holomorphic discs and our recent joint-work with Pflug on cross theorems in dimension 1. It also relies on our new technique of conformal mappings and a generalization of Siciak's relative extremal function. Our approach illustrates the unified character: ``From local informations to global extensions". Moreover, it avoids systematically the use of the classical method of doubly orthogonal bases of Bergman type.

Higher spin algebras as higher symmetries - The exhaustive study of the rigid symmetries of arbitrary free field theories is motivated, along several lines, as a preliminary step in the completion of the higher-spin interaction problem in full generality. Some results for the simplest example (a scalar field) are reviewed and commented along these lines.

CalFUSE v3: A Data-Reduction Pipeline for the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer - Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) has made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data are reduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University and archived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). The data-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably over the lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently been reprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper describes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and the format of the resulting calibrated data files.

Voltage-Current curves for small Josephson junction arrays - We compute the current voltage characteristic of a chain of identical Josephson circuits characterized by a large ratio of Josephson to charging energy that are envisioned as the implementation of topologically protected qubits. We show that in the limit of small coupling to the environment it exhibits a non-monotonous behavior with a maximum voltage followed by a parametrically large region where $V\propto 1/I$. We argue that its experimental measurement provides a direct probe of the amplitude of the quantum transitions in constituting Josephson circuits and thus allows their full characterization.

The density of critical percolation clusters touching the boundaries of strips and squares - We consider the density of two-dimensional critical percolation clusters, constrained to touch one or both boundaries, in infinite strips, half-infinite strips, and squares, as well as several related quantities for the infinite strip. Our theoretical results follow from conformal field theory, and are compared with high-precision numerical simulation. For example, we show that the density of clusters touching both boundaries of an infinite strip of unit width (i.e. crossing clusters) is proportional to $(\sin \pi y)^{-5/48}\{[\cos(\pi y/2)]^{1/3} +[\sin (\pi y/2)]^{1/3}-1\}$. We also determine numerically contours for the density of clusters crossing squares and long rectangles with open boundaries on the sides, and compare with theory for the density along an edge.

Effective band-structure in the insulating phase versus strong dynamical correlations in metallic VO2 - Using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical mean field calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolved spectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulating phases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects prevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the latter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an orbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full many-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle description. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old question of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-body Peierls'' state.

New possible properties of atomic nuclei investigated by non linear methods: Fractal and recurrence quantification analysis - For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and, using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally, using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches. In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear methods is further required.

The Use of Weighting in Periodicity Searches in All-Sky Monitor Data: Applications to the GLAST LAT - The light curves produced by all-sky monitors, such as the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), generally have non-uniform error bars. In searching for periodic modulation in this type of data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of data points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a modified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives improved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefits of weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LAT observations of gamma-ray binaries.

Dielectronic Recombination of Fe XV forming Fe XIV: Laboratory Measurements and Theoretical Calculations - We have measured resonance strengths and energies for dielectronic recombination (DR) of Mg-like Fe XV forming Al-like Fe XIV via N=3 -> N' = 3 core excitations in the electron-ion collision energy range 0-45 eV. All measurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also carried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using the AUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor agreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and strengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for resonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance strengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than our estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26% (at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between the calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly to the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in the experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by our AUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR rate coefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient is estimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) for k_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predicted to form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found between our experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously published theoretical results. Our new MCBP plasma rate coefficient is 19-28% smaller than our experimental results over this temperature range.

Metropolis algorithm and equienergy sampling for two mean field spin systems - In this paper we study the Metropolis algorithm in connection with two mean--field spin systems, the so called mean--field Ising model and the Blume--Emery--Griffiths model. In both this examples the naive choice of proposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolis chain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the dimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in the proposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost similar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with a suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap which decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the energy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level of the starting state.

Experimental Test of the High-Frequency Quantum Shot Noise Theory in a Quantum Point Contact - We report on direct measurements of the electronic shot noise of a quantum point contact at frequencies nu in the range 4-8 GHz. The very small energy scale used ensures energy independent transmissions of the few transmitted electronic modes and their accurate knowledge. Both the thermal energy and the quantum point contact drain-source voltage Vds are comparable to the photon energy hnu leading to observation of the shot noise suppression when $V_{ds}<h\nu/e$. Our measurements provide the first complete test of the finite frequency shot noise scattering theory without adjustable parameters.

Extragalactic Radio Sources and the WMAP Cold Spot - We detect a dip of 20-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NVSS sources smoothed to a few degrees at the location of the WMAP cold spot. The dip has structure on scales of approximately 1-10 degrees. Together with independent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are physically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from structures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single region. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires a ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This is far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds to the anomalies seen in the CMB.

L^2 rho form for normal coverings of fibre bundles - We define the secondary invariants L^2- eta and -rho forms for families of generalized Dirac operators on normal coverings of fibre bundles. On the covering family we assume transversally smooth spectral projections, and Novikov--Shubin invariants bigger than 3(dim B+1) to treat the large time asymptotic for general operators. In the particular case of a bundle of spin manifolds, we study the L^2- rho class in relation to the space of positive scalar curvature vertical metrics.

On the Nonexistence of Nontrivial Involutive n-Homomorphisms of C*-algebras - An n-homomorphism between algebras is a linear map $\phi : A \to B$ such that $\phi(a_1 ... a_n) = \phi(a_1)... \phi(a_n)$ for all elements $a_1, >..., a_n \in A.$ Every homomorphism is an n-homomorphism, for all n >= 2, but the converse is false, in general. Hejazian et al. [7] ask: Is every *-preserving n-homomorphism between C*-algebras continuous? We answer their question in the affirmative, but the even and odd n arguments are surprisingly disjoint. We then use these results to prove stronger ones: If n >2 is even, then $\phi$ is just an ordinary *-homomorphism. If n >= 3 is odd, then $\phi$ is a difference of two orthogonal *-homomorphisms. Thus, there are no nontrivial *-linear n-homomorphisms between C*-algebras.

Smooth and Starburst Tidal Tails in the GEMS and GOODS Fields - GEMS and GOODS fields were examined to z~1.4 for galaxy interactions and mergers. The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails, tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal arm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts. Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails, indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a 5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to 1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their separations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational instabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies have to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas column densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.

Nuclear Spin Effects in Optical Lattice Clocks - We present a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the effect of nuclear spin on the performance of optical lattice clocks. With a state-mixing theory including spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions, we describe the origin of the $^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ clock transition and the differential g-factor between the two clock states for alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, using $^{87}$Sr as an example. Clock frequency shifts due to magnetic and optical fields are discussed with an emphasis on those relating to nuclear structure. An experimental determination of the differential g-factor in $^{87}$Sr is performed and is in good agreement with theory. The magnitude of the tensor light shift on the clock states is also explored experimentally. State specific measurements with controlled nuclear spin polarization are discussed as a method to reduce the nuclear spin-related systematic effects to below 10$^{-17}$ in lattice clocks.

Domain wall switching: optimizing the energy landscape - It has recently been suggested that exchange spring media offer a way to increase media density without causing thermal instability (superparamagnetism), by using a hard and a soft layer coupled by exchange. Victora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio of the energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching field, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2 for an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability (determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this formulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can be no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess et al comes very close to this limit.

Electromagnetic wormholes via handlebody constructions - Cloaking devices are prescriptions of electrostatic, optical or electromagnetic parameter fields (conductivity $\sigma(x)$, index of refraction $n(x)$, or electric permittivity $\epsilon(x)$ and magnetic permeability $\mu(x)$) which are piecewise smooth on $\mathbb R^3$ and singular on a hypersurface $\Sigma$, and such that objects in the region enclosed by $\Sigma$ are not detectable to external observation by waves. Here, we give related constructions of invisible tunnels, which allow electromagnetic waves to pass between possibly distant points, but with only the ends of the tunnels visible to electromagnetic imaging. Effectively, these change the topology of space with respect to solutions of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to attaching a handlebody to $\mathbb R^3$. The resulting devices thus function as electromagnetic wormholes.

Millimeter-Thick Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Forests: Hidden Role of Catalyst Support - A parametric study of so-called "super growth" of single-walled carbon nanotubes(SWNTs) was done by using combinatorial libraries of iron/aluminum oxide catalysts. Millimeter-thick forests of nanotubes grew within 10 min, and those grown by using catalysts with a thin Fe layer (about 0.5 nm) were SWNTs. Although nanotube forests grew under a wide range of reaction conditions such as gas composition and temperature, the window for SWNT was narrow. Fe catalysts rapidly grew nanotubes only when supported on aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide, which is a well-known catalyst in hydrocarbon reforming, plays an essential role in enhancing the nanotube growth rates.

Test of nuclear level density inputs for Hauser-Feshbach model calculations - The energy spectra of neutrons, protons, and alpha-particles have been measured from the d+59Co and 3He+58Fe reactions leading to the same compound nucleus, 61$Ni. The experimental cross sections have been compared to Hauser-Feshbach model calculations using different input level density models. None of them have been found to agree with experiment. It manifests the serious problem with available level density parameterizations especially those based on neutron resonance spacings and density of discrete levels. New level densities and corresponding Fermi-gas parameters have been obtained for reaction product nuclei such as 60Ni,60Co, and 57Fe.

The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets. IX. Exoplanets orbiting HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287 - The HARPS high-resolution high-accuracy spectrograph is offered to the astronomical community since the second half of 2003. Since then, we have been using this instrument for monitoring radial velocities of a large sample of Solar-type stars (~1400 stars) in order to search for their possible low-mass companions. Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increase the number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample to improve our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtain better constraints for planet-formation models. In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital solutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The radial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1 M_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital fit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a long-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric orbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit. The shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal temporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We find clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile variations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.

Algebraic geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks - Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables. This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models. Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.

Interactions, superconducting $T_c$, and fluctuation magnetization for two coupled dots in the crossover between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles - We study a system of two quantum dots connected by a hopping bridge. Both the dots and connecting region are assumed to be in universal crossover regimes between Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. Using a diagrammatic approach appropriate for energy separations much larger than the level spacing we obtain the ensemble-averaged one- and two-particle Green's functions. It turns out that the diffuson and cooperon parts of the two-particle Green's function can be described by separate scaling functions. We then use this information to investigate a model interacting system in which one dot has an attractive s-wave reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, while the other is noninteracting but subject to an orbital magnetic field. We find that the critical temperature is {\it nonmonotonic} in the flux through the second dot in a certain regime of interdot coupling. Likewise, the fluctuation magnetization above the critical temperature is also nonmonotonic in this regime, can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and can be deduced from the cooperon scaling function.

Two-proton radioactivity and three-body decay. III. Integral formulae for decay widths in a simplified semianalytical approach - Three-body decays of resonant states are studied using integral formulae for decay widths. Theoretical approach with a simplified Hamiltonian allows semianalytical treatment of the problem. The model is applied to decays of the first excited $3/2^{-}$ state of $^{17}$Ne and the $3/2^{-}$ ground state of $^{45}$Fe. The convergence of three-body hyperspherical model calculations to the exact result for widths and energy distributions are studied. The theoretical results for $^{17}$Ne and $^{45}$Fe decays are updated and uncertainties of the derived values are discussed in detail. Correlations for the decay of $^{17}$Ne $3/2^-$ state are also studied.

Z^0 \to 2\gamma and the Twisted Coproduct of the Poincar\'{e} Group - Yang's theorem forbids the process $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ in any Poincar\'{e} invariant theory if photons are bosons and their two-particle states transform under the Poincar\'{e} group in the standard way (under the standard coproduct of the Poincar\'{e} group). This is an important result as it does not depend on the assumptions of quantum field theory. Recent work on noncommutative geometry requires deforming the above coproduct by the Drinfel'd twist. We prove that $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well. This result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As an illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0 \to \nu + \nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the Poincar\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not conserved. This is a special case of our general result that a massive particle of spin $j$ cannot decay into two identical massless particles of the same helicity if $j$ is odd, regardless of the coproduct used.

A variation of Gronwall's lemma - We prove a variation of Gronwall's lemma.

When the Cramer-Rao Inequality provides no information - We investigate a one-parameter family of probability densities (related to the Pareto distribution, which describes many natural phenomena) where the Cramer-Rao inequality provides no information.

Lower order terms in the 1-level density for families of holomorphic cuspidal newforms - The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior. We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections, depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

Spinor Dynamics in an Antiferromagnetic Spin-1 Condensate - We observe coherent spin oscillations in an antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate of sodium. The variation of the spin oscillations with magnetic field shows a clear signature of nonlinearity, in agreement with theory, which also predicts anharmonic oscillations near a critical magnetic field. Measurements of the magnetic phase diagram agree with predictions made in the approximation of a single spatial mode. The oscillation period yields the best measurement to date of the sodium spin-dependent interaction coefficient, determining that the difference between the sodium spin-dependent s-wave scattering lengths $a_{f=2}-a_{f=0}$ is $2.47\pm0.27$ Bohr radii.

A Contraction Theory Approach to Stochastic Incremental Stability - We investigate the incremental stability properties of It\^o stochastic dynamical systems. Specifically, we derive a stochastic version of nonlinear contraction theory that provides a bound on the mean square distance between any two trajectories of a stochastically contracting system. This bound can be expressed as a function of the noise intensity and the contraction rate of the noise-free system. We illustrate these results in the contexts of stochastic nonlinear observers design and stochastic synchronization.

A Symplectic Test of the L-Functions Ratios Conjecture - Recently Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer conjectured formulas for the averages over a family of ratios of products of shifted L-functions. Their L-functions Ratios Conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for many problems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers and moments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showing agreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory; however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known. These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios Conjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic family of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental discriminants d \le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect agreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show agreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this family and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the Ratios Conjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.

Cosmology from String Theory - We explore the cosmological content of Salam-Sezgin six dimensional supergravity, and find a solution to the field equations in qualitative agreement with observation of distant supernovae, primordial nucleosynthesis abundances, and recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The carrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence field slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold dark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the quintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context). However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold dark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter energy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of supersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure constant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3) ``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4) the long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a Robertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3). Finally, we present a String theory background by lifting our six dimensional cosmological solution to ten dimensions.

Noncommutative Electromagnetism As A Large N Gauge Theory - We map noncommutative (NC) U(1) gauge theory on R^d_C X R^{2n}_{NC} to U(N -> \infty) Yang-Mills theory on R^d_C, where R^d_C is a d-dimensional commutative spacetime while R^{2n}_{NC} is a 2n-dimensional NC space. The resulting U(N) Yang-Mills theory on R^d_C is equivalent to that obtained by the dimensional reduction of (d+2n)-dimensional U(N) Yang-Mills theory onto R^d_C. We show that the gauge-Higgs system (A_\mu,\Phi^a) in the U(N -> \infty) Yang-Mills theory on R^d_C leads to an emergent geometry in the (d+2n)-dimensional spacetime whose metric was determined by Ward a long time ago. In particular, the 10-dimensional gravity for d=4 and n=3 corresponds to the emergent geometry arising from the 4-dimensional N=4 vector multiplet in the AdS/CFT duality. We further elucidate the emergent gravity by showing that the gauge-Higgs system (A_\mu,\Phi^a) in half-BPS configurations describes self-dual Einstein gravity.

Marginal Solutions for the Superstring - We construct a class of analytic solutions of WZW-type open superstring field theory describing marginal deformations of a reference D-brane background. The deformations we consider are generated by on-shell vertex operators with vanishing operator products. The superstring solution exhibits an intriguing duality with the corresponding marginal solution of the {\it bosonic} string. In particular, the superstring problem is ``dual'' to the problem of re-expressing the bosonic marginal solution in pure gauge form. This represents the first nonsingular analytic solution of open superstring field theory.

The Isophotal Structure of Early-Type Galaxies in the SDSS: Dependence on AGN Activity and Environment - We study the dependence of the isophotal shape of early-type galaxies on their absolute B-band magnitude, their dynamical mass, and their nuclear activity and environment, using an unprecedented large sample of 847 early-type galaxies identified in the SDSS by Hao et al (2006). We find that the fraction of disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The large sample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear relations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the isophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations between the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the optical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group hierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be accurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy luminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity, nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shape of early-type galaxies.

On the Origin of the Dichotomy of Early-Type Galaxies: The Role of Dry Mergers and AGN Feedback - Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} < 0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1} \Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.

Quantum and Classical Spins on the Spatially Distorted Kagome Lattice: Applications to Volborthite - In Volborthite, spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\'e lattice, of corner sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$ on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration. Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.

Two-proton radioactivity and three-body decay. IV. Connection to quasiclassical formulation - We derive quasiclassical expressions for the three-body decay width and define the ``preexponential'' coefficients for them. The derivation is based on the integral formulae for the three-body width obtained in the semianalytical approach with simplified three-body Hamiltonian [L.V. Grigorenko and M.V.\ Zhukov, arXiv:0704.0920v1]. The model is applied to the decays of the first excited $3/2^{-}$ state of $^{17}$Ne and $3/2^{-}$ ground state of $^{45}$Fe. Various qualitative aspects of the model and relations with the other simplified approaches to the three-body decays are discussed.

Percolation Modeling of Conductance of Self-Healing Composites - We explore the conductance of self-healing materials as a measure of the material integrity in the regime of the onset of the initial fatigue. Continuum effective-field modeling and lattice numerical simulations are reported. Our results illustrate the general features of the self-healing process: The onset of the material fatigue is delayed, by developing a plateau-like time-dependence of the material quality. We demonstrate that in this low-damage regime, the changes in the conductance and similar transport/response properties of the material can be used as measures of the material quality degradation.

Analytic solutions for marginal deformations in open superstring field theory - We extend the calculable analytic approach to marginal deformations recently developed in open bosonic string field theory to open superstring field theory formulated by Berkovits. We construct analytic solutions to all orders in the deformation parameter when operator products made of the marginal operator and the associated superconformal primary field are regular.

Invariants of Triangular Lie Algebras - Triangular Lie algebras are the Lie algebras which can be faithfully represented by triangular matrices of any finite size over the real/complex number field. In the paper invariants ('generalized Casimir operators') are found for three classes of Lie algebras, namely those which are either strictly or non-strictly triangular, and for so-called special upper triangular Lie algebras. Algebraic algorithm of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2006, V.39, 5749; math-ph/0602046], developed further in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 2007, V.40, 113; math-ph/0606045], is used to determine the invariants. A conjecture of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2001, V.34, 9085], concerning the number of independent invariants and their form, is corroborated.

Approaching equilibrium and the distribution of clusters - We investigate the approach to stable and metastable equilibrium in Ising models using a cluster representation. The distribution of nucleation times is determined using the Metropolis algorithm and the corresponding $\phi^{4}$ model using Langevin dynamics. We find that the nucleation rate is suppressed at early times even after global variables such as the magnetization and energy have apparently reached their time independent values. The mean number of clusters whose size is comparable to the size of the nucleating droplet becomes time independent at about the same time that the nucleation rate reaches its constant value. We also find subtle structural differences between the nucleating droplets formed before and after apparent metastable equilibrium has been established.

Does the Blazar Gamma-Ray Spectrum Harden with Increasing Flux? Analysis of 9 Years of EGRET Data - The Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) discovered gamma-ray emission from more than 67 blazars during its 9 yr lifetime. We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET archives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and were bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law models. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6 low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral index with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for spectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases. There is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in five blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS 1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral dependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We observed a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in all three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were available. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the widely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in the context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible for emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps that were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.

Glueball Masses in (2+1)-Dimensional Anisotropic Weakly-Coupled Yang-Mills Theory - The confinement problem has been solved in the anisotropic (2+1)-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at weak coupling. In this paper, we find the low-lying spectrum for N=2. The lightest excitations are pairs of fundamental particles of the (1+1)-dimensional SU(2)XSU(2) principal chiral sigma model bound in a linear potential, with a specified matching condition where the particles overlap. This matching condition can be determined from the exactly-known S-matrix for the sigma model.

Recovering galaxy star formation and metallicity histories from spectra using VESPA - We introduce VErsatile SPectral Analysis (VESPA): a new method which aims to recover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra. VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic models. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on the signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover between 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.

Axiom A polynomial skew products of C^2 and their postcritical sets - A polynomial skew product of C^2 is a map of the form f(z,w) = (p(z), q(z,w)), where p and q are polynomials, such that f is regular of degree d >= 2. For polynomial maps of C, hyperbolicity is equivalent to the condition that the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the Julia set; further, critical points either iterate to an attracting cycle or infinity. For polynomial skew products, Jonsson (Math. Ann., 1999) established that f is Axiom A if and only if the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the right analog of the Julia set. Here we present the analogous conclusion: critical orbits either escape to infinity or accumulate on an attracting set. In addition, we construct new examples of Axiom A maps demonstrating various postcritical behaviors.

Search for gravitational-wave bursts in LIGO data from the fourth science run - The fourth science run of the LIGO and GEO 600 gravitational-wave detectors, carried out in early 2005, collected data with significantly lower noise than previous science runs. We report on a search for short-duration gravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the 64-1600 Hz frequency range appearing in all three LIGO interferometers. Signal consistency tests, data quality cuts, and auxiliary-channel vetoes are applied to reduce the rate of spurious triggers. No gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 days of live observation time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 0.15 per day (at 90% confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to be detected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized using Monte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previous searches. We also provide rough estimates of the distances at which representative supernova and binary black hole merger signals could be detected with 50% efficiency by this analysis.

GLAST and Dark Matter Substructure in the Milky Way - We discuss the possibility of GLAST detecting gamma-rays from the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the Galactic halo. We have used "Via Lactea", currently the highest resolution simulation of Galactic cold dark matter substructure, to quantify the contribution of subhalos to the annihilation signal. We present a simulated allsky map of the expected gamma-ray counts from dark matter annihilation, assuming standard values of particle mass and cross section. In this case GLAST should be able to detect the Galactic center and several individual subhalos.

Gibbs fragmentation trees - We study fragmentation trees of Gibbs type. In the binary case, we identify the most general Gibbs-type fragmentation tree with Aldous' beta-splitting model, which has an extended parameter range $\beta>-2$ with respect to the ${\rm beta}(\beta+1,\beta+1)$ probability distributions on which it is based. In the multifurcating case, we show that Gibbs fragmentation trees are associated with the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet models for exchangeable random partitions of $\mathbb {N}$, with an extended parameter range $0\le\alpha\le1$, $\theta\ge-2\alpha$ and $\alpha<0$, $\theta =-m\alpha$, $m\in \mathbb {N}$.

Efficient Simulations of Early Structure Formation and Reionization - We present a method to construct semi-numerical ``simulations'', which can efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such large scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical approach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation and reionization.

Jet-disturbed molecular gas near the Seyfert 2 nucleus in M51 - Previous molecular gas observations at arcsecond-scale resolution of the Seyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotating disk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it from direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2) observations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating disk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter- or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.

Spectroscopy of Nine Cataclysmic Variable Stars - We present optical spectroscopy of nine cataclysmic binary stars, mostly dwarf novae, obtained primarily to determine orbital periods Porb. The stars and their periods are LX And, 0.1509743(5) d; CZ Aql, 0.2005(6) d; LU Cam, 0.1499686(4) d; GZ Cnc, 0.0881(4) d; V632 Cyg, 0.06377(8) d; V1006 Cyg, 0.09903(9) d; BF Eri, 0.2708804(4) d; BI Ori, 0.1915(5) d; and FO Per, for which Porb is either 0.1467(4) or 0.1719(5) d. Several of the stars proved to be especially interesting. In BF Eri, we detect the absorption spectrum of a secondary star of spectral type K3 +- 1 subclass, which leads to a distance estimate of approximately 1 kpc. However, BF Eri has a large proper motion (100 mas/yr), and we have a preliminary parallax measurement that confirms the large proper motion and yields only an upper limit for the parallax. BF Eri's space velocity is evidently large, and it appears to belong to the halo population. In CZ Aql, the emission lines have strong wings that move with large velocity amplitude, suggesting a magnetically-channeled accretion flow. The orbital period of V1006 Cyg places it squarely within the 2- to 3-hour "gap" in the distribution of cataclysmic binary orbital periods.

Conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions - The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps. Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of our main result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when one consider maps that are ergodic.

Displacement of the Sun from the Galactic Plane - We have carried out a comparative statistical study for the displacement of the Sun from the Galactic plane (z_\odot) following three different methods. The study has been done using a sample of 537 young open clusters (YOCs) with log(Age) < 8.5 lying within a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and 2030 OB stars observed up to a distance of 1200 pc, all of them have distance information. We decompose the Gould Belt's member in a statistical sense before investigating the variation in the z_\odot estimation with different upper cut-off limits in the heliocentric distance and distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane. We found z_\odot varies in a range of ~ 13 - 20 pc from the analys is of YOCs and ~ 6 - 18 pc from the OB stars. A significant scatter in the z_\odot obtained due to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no such deviation is seen for the YOCs. We also determined scale heights of 56.9(+3.8)(-3.4} and 61.4(+2.7)(-2.4) pc for the distribution of YOCs and OB stars respectively.

Correlation amplitude and entanglement entropy in random spin chains - Using strong-disorder renormalization group, numerical exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo methods, we revisit the random antiferromagnetic XXZ spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent) power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3, otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e = -1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered. Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal. The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties, interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.

SIM PlanetQuest: The Most Promising Near-Term Technique to Detect, Find Masses, and Determine Three-Dimensional Orbits of Nearby Habitable Planets - The past two Decadal Surveys in Astronomy and Astrophysics recommended the completion of a space-based interferometry mission, known today as SIM PlanetQuest, for its unique ability to detect and characterize nearby rocky planets (Bahcall 1991, McKee & Taylor 2001), as well as contributions to a broad range of problems in astrophysics. Numerous committees of the National Research Council as well as NASA Roadmaps have similarly highlighted SIM as the one technology that offers detection and characterization of rocky planets around nearby stars and which is technically ready. To date, SIM remains the only program with the capability of detecting and confirming rocky planets in the habitable zones of nearby solar-type stars. Moreover, SIM measures masses and three-dimensional orbits of habitable planets around nearby stars (within 25 pc); these are the only stars for which follow-up by other techniques is feasible, such as space-based spectroscopy, ground-based interferometry, and of course TPF.

IR observations of MS 1054-03: Star Formation and its Evolution in Rich Galaxy Clusters - We study the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03 at z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400 galaxies and a very deep K-band selected catalog. 19 IR cluster members are selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03 also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A nonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward; instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed Consensus - In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate, or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link. These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate. The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2) establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail; and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

Charges from Attractors - We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black holes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges of appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the near-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.

Nodeless d-wave superconducting pairing due to residual antiferromagnetism in underdoped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ - We have investigated the doping dependence of the penetration depth vs. temperature in electron doped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ using a model which assumes the uniform coexistence of (mean-field) antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. Despite the presence of a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing gap in the underlying spectrum, we find nodeless behavior of the low-$T$ penetration depth in underdoped case, in accord with experimental results. As doping increases, a linear-in-$T$ behavior of the penetration depth, characteristic of d-wave pairing, emerges as the lower magnetic band crosses the Fermi level and creates a nodal Fermi surface pocket.

One-dimensional Brownian particle systems with rank dependent drifts - We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate processes at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long range behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.

Simultaneous Swift and REM monitoring of the blazar PKS0537-441 in 2005 - The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60 brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005 observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state, monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations, but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a unique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are interpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a jet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends on the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).

Theoretical Status of Pentaquarks - We review the current status of the theoretical pentaquark search from the direct QCD calculation. The works from the QCD sum rule and the lattice QCD in the literature are carefully examined. The importance of the framework which can distinguish the exotic pentaquark state (if any) from the NK scattering state is emphasized.

Generating Squeezed States of Nanomechanical Resonator - We propose a scheme for generating squeezed states in solid state circuits consisting of a nanomechanical resonator (NMR), a superconducting Cooper-pair box (CPB) and a superconducting transmission line resonator (STLR). The nonlinear interaction between the NMR and the STLR can be implemented by setting the external biased flux of the CPB at certain values. The interaction Hamiltonian between the NMR and the STLR is derived by performing Fr$\rm\ddot o$hlich transformation on the total Hamiltonian of the combined system. Just by adiabatically keeping the CPB at the ground state, we get the standard parametric down-conversion Hamiltonian. The CPB plays the role of ``nonlinear media", and the squeezed states of the NMR can be easily generated in a manner similar to the three-wave mixing in quantum optics. This is the three-wave mixing in a solid-state circuit.

On the orbital period of the magnetic Cataclysmic Variable HS 0922+1333 - Context: The object HS 0922+1333 was visited briefly in 2002 in a mini survey of low accretion rate polars (LARPs) in order to test if they undergo high luminosity states similar to ordinary polars. On the basis of that short observation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar (Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin period appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observations of the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of radial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and brightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results: New observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital and spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of confusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission line arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.

The Einstein-Varicak Correspondence on Relativistic Rigid Rotation - The historical significance of the problem of relativistic rigid rotation is reviewed in light of recently published correspondence between Einstein and the mathematician Vladimir Varicak from the years 1909 to 1913.

Nova Geminorum 1912 and the Origin of the Idea of Gravitational Lensing - Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a scratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hitherto unknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in his path towards general relativity.

Upper bounds on entangling rates of bipartite Hamiltonians - We discuss upper bounds on the rate at which unitary evolution governed by a non-local Hamiltonian can generate entanglement in a bipartite system. Given a bipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, the entangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is the smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator norm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the initial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted entangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local ancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct Schmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large multiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional measuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent state with a state evolving unitarily.

Separability Criterion for Multipartite Pure States - In this paper, we give out some effective criterions which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states. We obtain the relationship between separability and Schmidt decomposable of multipartite pure states in Theorem1. The first criterion derived from Theorem2 dose not need the Schmidt decomposition which is hard to find for multipartite states. Theorem3 is more profound which can be used to deduce Corollary1 which is one of the main results in [1]. Finally, we give out an algorithm which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states effectively.

Cluster properties from two-particle angular correlations in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 and 410 GeV - We present results on two-particle angular correlations in proton-proton collisions at center of mass energies of 200 and 410 GeV. The PHOBOS experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has a uniquely large coverage for charged particles, giving the opportunity to explore the correlations at both short- and long-range scales. At both energies, a complex two-dimensional correlation structure in $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \phi$ is observed. In the context of an independent cluster model of short-range correlations, the cluster size and its decay width are extracted from the two-particle pseudorapidity correlation function and compared with previous measurements in proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions, as well as PYTHIA and HIJING predictions.

Cross-Layer Optimization of MIMO-Based Mesh Networks with Gaussian Vector Broadcast Channels - MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to increase channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity for mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient method. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network performance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.

Criteria in the Selection of Target Events for Planetary Microlensing Follow-Up Observation - To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim 10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars with magnifications $A\gtrsim 70$.

The Necessary and Sufficient Conditions of Separability for Bipartite Pure States in Infinite Dimensional Hilbert Spaces - In this paper, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions of separability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Let $M$ be the matrix of the amplitudes of $\ket\psi$, we prove $M$ is a compact operator. We also prove $\ket\psi$ is separable if and only if $M$ is a bounded linear operator with rank 1, that is the image of $M$ is a one dimensional Hilbert space. So we have related the separability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces to an important class of bounded linear operators in Functional analysis which has many interesting properties.

Magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks - Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas. For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains, x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150 g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have aggregated to 1 micron in size.

D0-anti-D0 Mixing and CP Violation in D0 vs anti-D0 to K*(+-) K(-+) Decays - The noteworthy BaBar and Belle evidence for $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing motivates us to study its impact on $D^0\to K^{*\pm} K^\mp$ decays and their CP-conjugate processes. We show that both the $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing parameters ($x$ and $y$) and the strong phase difference between $\bar{D}^0\to K^{*\pm}K^\mp$ and $D^0\to K^{*\pm}K^\mp$ transitions ($\delta$) can be determined or constrained from the time-dependent measurements of these decay modes. On the $\psi (3770)$ and $\psi (4140)$ resonances at a $\tau$-charm factory, it is even possible to determine or constrain $x$, $y$ and $\delta$ from the time-independent measurements of coherent $(D^0\bar{D}^0) \to (K^{*\pm} K^\mp)(K^{*\pm} K^\mp)$ decays. If the CP-violating phase of $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing is significant in a scenario beyond the standard model, it can also be extracted from the $K^{*\pm} K^\mp$ events.

The dissolution of the vacancy gas and grain boundary diffusion in crystalline solids - Based on the formula for the number density of vacancies in a solid under the stress or tension, the model of grain boundary diffusion in crystalline solids is developed. We obtain the activation energy of grain boundary diffusion (dependent on the surface tension or the energy of the grain boundary) and also the distributions of vacancies and the diffusing species in the vicinity of the grain boundary.

X-ray Timing Observations of PSR J1930+1852 in the Crab-like SNR G54.1+0.3 - We present new X-ray timing and spectral observations of PSR J1930+1852, the young energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnant G54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra X-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms pulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution shows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of $\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise and/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$ modulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\sim 70%$ duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed emission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\Gamma = 1.2\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The total 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.

Vortex-induced topological transition of the bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice - The ordering of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice with the the bilinear-biquadratic interaction is studied by Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the model exhibits a topological phase transition at a finite-temperature driven by topologically stable vortices, while the spin correlation length remains finite even at and below the transition point. The relevant vortices could be of three different types, depending on the value of the biquadratic coupling. Implications to recent experiments on the triangular antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$ is discussed.

Recurrence analysis of the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect - Tensile tests were carried out by deforming polycrystalline samples of Al-2.5%Mg alloy at room temperature in a wide range of strain rates where the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was observed. The experimental stress-time series data have been analyzed using the recurrence analysis technique based on the Recurrence Plot (RP) and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to study the change in the dynamical behavior of the PLC effect with the imposed strain rate. Our study revealed that the RQA is able to detect the unique crossover phenomenon in the PLC dynamics.

A Topological Glass - We propose and study a model with glassy behavior. The state space of the model is given by all triangulations of a sphere with $n$ nodes, half of which are red and half are blue. Red nodes want to have 5 neighbors while blue ones want 7. Energies of nodes with different numbers of neighbors are supposed to be positive. The dynamics is that of flipping the diagonal of two adjacent triangles, with a temperature dependent probability. We show that this system has an approach to a steady state which is exponentially slow, and show that the stationary state is unordered. We also study the local energy landscape and show that it has the hierarchical structure known from spin glasses. Finally, we show that the evolution can be described as that of a rarefied gas with spontaneous generation of particles and annihilating collisions.

Anomalous pressure behavior of tangential modes in single-wall carbon nanotubes - Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have studied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), a constant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to D2h then to C2h.

Distribution of the molecular absorption in front of the quasar B0218+357 - The line of sight to the quasar B0218+357, one of the most studied lensed systems, intercepts a z=0.68 spiral galaxy, which splits its image into two main components A and B, separated by ca. 0.3'', and gives rise to molecular absorption. Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise in front of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from other velocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle this question, we have observed the HCO+(2-1) absorption line during the commissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as a function of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowed us to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component. Our results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components of the HCO+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of the quasar. We estimate a flux ratio fA/fB = 4.2 (-1.0;+1.8 at 106 GHz.

Cosmogenic neutrinos as a probe of the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays - There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in the spectrum of cosmic rays at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\it ankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair production on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dip scenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at $\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim 10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$ eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim 10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

Spin state mixing in InAs double quantum dots - We quantify the contributions of hyperfine and spin-orbit mediated singlet-triplet mixing in weakly coupled InAs quantum dots by electron transport spectroscopy in the Pauli spin blockade regime. In contrast to double dots in GaAs, the spin-orbit coupling is found to be more than two orders of magnitudes larger than the hyperfine mixing energy. It is already effective at magnetic fields of a few mT, where deviations from hyperfine mixing are observed.

Construction of Complete Embedded Self-Similar Surfaces under Mean Curvature Flow. Part II - We study the Dirichlet problem associated to the equation for self-similar surfaces for graphs over the Euclidean plane with a disk removed. We show the existence of a solution provided the boundary conditions on the boundary circle are small enough and satisfy some symmetries. This is the second step towards the construction of new examples of complete embedded self similar surfaces under mean curvature flow.

Daemons and DAMA: Their Celestial-Mechanics Interrelations - The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged Planckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by the St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time. Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields ~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.

Form factors of the exotic baryons with isospin I=5/2 - The electromagnetic form factors of the exotic baryons are calculated in the framework of the relativistic quark model at small and intermediate momentum transfer. The charge radii of the E+++ baryons are determined.

Transfer of a Polaritonic Qubit through a Coupled Cavity Array - We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of an array of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system (atoms or quantum dots) and the detuning of the atomic level spacing and photonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in the array. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected cavities.

Architecture for Pseudo Acausal Evolvable Embedded Systems - Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.

On reference frames in spacetime and gravitational energy in freely falling frames - We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames in spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and show that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of gravitational energy.

A kind of prediction from string phenomenology: extra matter at low energy - We review the possibility that the Supersymmetric Standard Model arises from orbifold constructions of the E_8 x E_8 Heterotic Superstring, and the phenomenological properties that such a model should have. In particular, trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by the Heterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEP experiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies of three families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies on the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient, together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an interesting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable lebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined with other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled way. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear when fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with several Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding that viable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.

Evidence for a Massive Protocluster in S255N - S255N is a luminous far-infrared source that contains many indications of active star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. We present mid-infrared through radio observations aimed at exploring the evolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and spectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm water maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core (SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1 also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct evidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.

Enumerating limit groups - We prove that the set of limit groups is recursive, answering a question of Delzant. One ingredient of the proof is the observation that a finitely presented group with local retractions (a la Long and Reid) is coherent and, furthermore, there exists an algorithm that computes presentations for finitely generated subgroups. The other main ingredient is the ability to algorithmically calculate centralizers in relatively hyperbolic groups. Applications include the existence of recognition algorithms for limit groups and free groups.

Dynamics of Size-Selected Gold Nanoparticles Studied by Ultrafast Electron Nanocrystallography - We report the studies of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography on size-selected Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface. Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigated with dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined with sub-picosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting, the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling, and upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming nanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at premelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence during photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization, where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree of structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend on the size of nanoparticle.

A Direct Method for Solving Optimal Switching Problems of One-Dimensional Diffusions - In this paper, we propose a direct solution method for optimal switching problems of one-dimensional diffusions. This method is free from conjectures about the form of the value function and switching strategies, or does not require the proof of optimality through quasi-variational inequalities. The direct method uses a general theory of optimal stopping problems for one-dimensional diffusions and characterizes the value function as sets of the smallest linear majorants in their respective transformed spaces.

Compatibility of radial, Lorenz and harmonic gauges - We observe that the radial gauge can be consistently imposed \emph{together} with the Lorenz gauge in Maxwell theory, and with the harmonic traceless gauge in linearized general relativity. This simple observation has relevance for some recent developments in quantum gravity where the radial gauge is implicitly utilized.

Late-time tails of a Yang-Mills field on Minkowski and Schwarzschild backgrounds - We study the late-time behavior of spherically symmetric solutions of the Yang-Mills equations on Minkowski and Schwarzschild backgrounds. Using nonlinear perturbation theory we show in both cases that solutions having smooth compactly supported initial data posses tails which decay as $t^{-4}$ at timelike infinity. Moreover, for small initial data on Minkowski background we derive the third-order formula for the amplitude of the tail and confirm numerically its accuracy.

Mediatic graphs - Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, with each token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcs of the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especially revealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic definition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any medium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite set S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a given set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.

Composite Structure and Causality - We study the question of whether a composite structure of elementary particles, with a length scale $1/\Lambda$, can leave observable effects of non-locality and causality violation at higher energies (but $\lesssim \Lambda$). We formulate a model-independent approach based on Bogoliubov-Shirkov formulation of causality. We analyze the relation between the fundamental theory (of finer constituents) and the derived theory (of composite particles). We assume that the fundamental theory is causal and formulate a condition which must be fulfilled for the derived theory to be causal. We analyze the condition and exhibit possibilities which fulfil and which violate the condition. We make comments on how causality violating amplitudes can arise.

Brane World Black Rings - Five dimensional neutral rotating black rings are described from a Randall-Sundrum brane world perspective in the bulk black string framework. To this end we consider a rotating black string extension of a five dimensional black ring into the bulk of a six dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world with a single four brane. The bulk solution intercepts the four brane in a five dimensional black ring with the usual curvature singularity on the brane. The bulk geodesics restricted to the plane of rotation of the black ring are constructed and their projections on the four brane match with the usual black ring geodesics restricted to the same plane. The asymptotic nature of the bulk geodesics are elucidated with reference to a bulk singularity at the AdS horizon. We further discuss the description of a brane world black ring as a limit of a boosted bulk black 2 brane with periodic identification.

Stable algebras of entire functions - Suppose that $h$ and $g$ belong to the algebra $\B$ generated by the rational functions and an entire function $f$ of finite order on ${\Bbb C}^n$ and that $h/g$ has algebraic polar variety. We show that either $h/g\in\B$ or $f=q_1e^p+q_2$, where $p$ is a polynomial and $q_1,q_2$ are rational functions. In the latter case, $h/g$ belongs to the algebra generated by the rational functions, $e^p$ and $e^{-p}$.

Test vectors for trilinear forms, when two representations are unramified and one is special - Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL(2,F). When V is the tensor product of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations of G, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a non zero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in its kernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors for some triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and they almost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most 1.

Generic character sheaves on disconnected groups and character values - We relate a generic character sheaf on a disconnected reductive group with a character of a representation of the rational points of the group over a finite field extending a result known in the connected case.

Measurement of D0-D0bar mixing in D0->Ks pi+ pi- decays - We report a measurement of D0-D0bar mixing in D0->Ks pi+ pi- decays using a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis. We first assume CP conservation and subsequently allow for CP violation. The results are based on 540 fb$^{-1}$ of data accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. Assuming negligible CP violation, we measure the mixing parameters $x=(0.80\pm0.29^{+0.09 +0.10}_{-0.07 -0.14})%$ and $y=(0.33\pm0.24^{+0.08 +0.06}_{-0.12 -0.08})%$, where the errors are statistical, experimental systematic, and systematic due to the Dalitz decay model, respectively. Allowing for CP violation, we obtain the $CPV$ parameters $|q/p|=0.86^{+0.30 +0.06}_{-0.29 -0.03}\pm0.08$ and $\arg(q/p)=(-14^{+16 +5 +2}_{-18 -3 -4})^\circ$.

Tautological relations in Hodge field theory - We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic properties of the reduction of Zwiebach invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants. It generalizes the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to the case of higher genera correlators with gravitational descendants. We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel conceptual proof.

SBF: multi-wavelength data and models - Recent applications have proved that the Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) technique is a reliable distance indicator in a wide range of distances, and a promising tool to analyze the physical and chemical properties of unresolved stellar systems, in terms of their metallicity and age. We present the preliminary results of a project aimed at studying the evolutionary properties and distance of the stellar populations in external galaxies based on the SBF method. On the observational side, we have succeeded in detecting I-band SBF gradients in six bright ellipticals imaged with the ACS, for these same objects we are now presenting also B-band SBF data. These B-band data are the first fluctuations magnitude measurements for galaxies beyond 10 Mpc. To analyze the properties of stellar populations from the data, accurate SBF models are essential. As a part of this project, we have evaluated SBF magnitudes from Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models specifically optimized for the purpose. A wide range of chemical compositions and ages, as well as different choices of the photometric system have been investigated. All models are available at the Teramo-Stellar Populations Tools web site: www.oa-teramo.inaf.it/SPoT.

On the choice of coarse variables for dynamics - Two ideas for the choice of an adequate set of coarse variables allowing approximate autonomous dynamics for practical applications are presented. The coarse variables are meant to represent averaged behavior of a fine-scale autonomous dynamics.

Simulating CCD images of elliptical galaxies - We introduce a procedure developed by the ``Teramo Stellar Populations Tools'' group (Teramo-SPoT), specifically optimized to obtain realistic simulations of CCD images of elliptical galaxies. Particular attention is devoted to include the Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) signal observed in ellipticals and to simulate the Globular Cluster (GC) system in the galaxy, and the distribution of background galaxies present in real CCD frames. In addition to the physical properties of the simulated objects - galaxy distance and brightness profile, luminosity function of GC and background galaxies, etc. - the tool presented allows the user to set some of the main instrumental properties - FoV, zero point magnitude, exposure time, etc.

Constructions of Kahler-Einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature - We show that on Kahler manifolds with negative first Chern class, the sequence of algebraic metrics introduced by H. Tsuji converges uniformly to the Kahler-Einstein metric. For algebraic surfaces of general type and orbifolds with isolated singularities, we prove a convergence result for a modified version of Tsuji's iterative construction.

A Denjoy Theorem for commuting circle diffeomorphisms with mixed Holder derivatives - We prove that if d is an integer number bigger than 1 and f_1,...,f_d are commuting circle diffeomorphisms respectively of class C^(1+\tau_k), where \tau_1 + ... + \tau_k > 1, then these maps are simultaneously conjugate to rotations provided that their rotation numbers are independent over the rationals.

Transient Dynamics of Sparsely Connected Hopfield Neural Networks with Arbitrary Degree Distributions - Using probabilistic approach, the transient dynamics of sparsely connected Hopfield neural networks is studied for arbitrary degree distributions. A recursive scheme is developed to determine the time evolution of overlap parameters. As illustrative examples, the explicit calculations of dynamics for networks with binomial, power-law, and uniform degree distribution are performed. The results are good agreement with the extensive numerical simulations. It indicates that with the same average degree, there is a gradual improvement of network performance with increasing sharpness of its degree distribution, and the most efficient degree distribution for global storage of patterns is the delta function.

Explicit HRS-Tilting - For an abelian category $A$ equipped with a torsion pair, we give an explicit description for the abelian category $B$ introduced by Happel-Reiten-Smalo, and also for the category of chain complexes $Ch(B)$ and the derived category $D(B)$ of $B$. We also describe the DG structure on $Ch(B)$. As a consequence, we find new proofs of certain results of Happel-Reiten-Smalo. The main ingredient is the category of {\em decorated} complexes.

Lectures on derived and triangulated categories - These notes are meant to provide a rapid introduction to triangulated categories. We start with the definition of an additive category and end with a glimps of tilting theory. Some exercises are included.

Group actions on algebraic stacks via butterflies - We introduce an explicit method for studying actions of a group stack G on an algebraic stack X. As an example, we study in detail the case where X=P(n_0,...,n_r) is a weighted projective stack over an arbitrary base S. To this end, we give an explicit description of the group stack of automorphisms of, the weighted projective general linear 2-group PGL(n_0,...,n_r). As an application, we use a result of Colliot-Thelene to show that for every linear algebraic group G over an arbitrary base field k (assumed to be reductive if char(k)>0) such that Pic}(G)=0, every action of G on P(n_0,...,n_r) lifts to a linear action of G on A^{r+1}.

Modal Extraction in Spatially Extended Systems - We describe a practical procedure for extracting the spatial structure and the growth rates of slow eigenmodes of a spatially extended system, using a unique experimental capability both to impose and to perturb desired initial states. The procedure is used to construct experimentally the spectrum of linear modes near the secondary instability boundary in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection. This technique suggests an approach to experimental characterization of more complex dynamical states such as periodic orbits or spatiotemporal chaos.

Unstable and Stable Galaxy Models - To determine the stability and instability of a given steady galaxy configuration is one of the fundamental problems in the Vlasov theory for galaxy dynamics. In this article, we study the stability of isotropic spherical symmetric galaxy models $f_{0}(E)$, for which the distribution function $f_{0}$ depends on the particle energy $E$ only. In the first part of the article, we derive the first sufficient criterion for linear instability of $f_{0}(E):$ $f_{0}(E)$ is linearly unstable if the second-order operator \[ A_{0}\equiv-\Delta+4\pi\int f_{0}^{\prime}(E)\{I-\mathcal{P}\}dv \] has a negative direction, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection onto the function space $\{g(E,L)\},$ $L$ being the angular momentum [see the explicit formula (\ref{A0-radial})]. In the second part of the article, we prove that for the important King model, the corresponding $A_{0}$ is positive definite. Such a positivity leads to the nonlinear stability of the King model under all spherically symmetric perturbations.

Flops connect minimal models - A remark on a paper by Birkar-Cascini-Hacon-McKernan.

A product formula for volumes of varieties - A simple application of the semipositivity.

An Alternative Topological Field Theory of Generalized Complex Geometry - We propose a new topological field theory on generalized complex geometry in two dimension using AKSZ formulation. Zucchini's model is $A$ model in the case that the generalized complex structuredepends on only a symplectic structure. Our new model is $B$ model in the case that the generalized complex structure depends on only a complex structure.

Phenomenological theory of spin excitations in La- and Y-based cuprates - Motivated by recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments on La-based cuprates and based on the fermiology theories, we study the spin susceptibility for La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g., YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$) cuprates, respectively. The spin excitation in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40 meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the incommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases dramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and the IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones, namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the superconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The spectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV) while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at the frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and local maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the Fermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the spin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of La-based cuprates. A coherent picture for the spin excitations is presented for Y-based and La-based cuprates.

Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice and experimental data on ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 - We compute the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice with high-temperature expansions and exact diagonalizations. We compare the results with the experimental data on ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 obtained by Helton et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 107204 (2007)]. Down to k_BT/J~0.2, our calculations reproduce accurately the experimental susceptibility, with an exchange interaction J~190K and a contribution of 3.7% of weakly interacting impurity spins. The comparison between our calculations of the specific heat and the experiments indicate that the low-temperature entropy (below ~20K) is smaller in ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 than in the kagome Heisenberg model, a likely signature of other interactions in the system.

Environmental dielectric screening effect on exciton transition energies in single-walled carbon nanotubes - Environmental dielectric screening effects on exciton transition energies in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in the range of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over trenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the excitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant ($\epsilon_{\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by several tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\epsilon_{\rm env} \sim 5$ without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be explained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron interaction. The $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can be expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\epsilon_{\rm env}$, $E_{\rm ii} = E_{\rm ii}^{\infty} + A\epsilon_{\rm env}^{-\alpha}$. We also immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate the effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\bf 3}, 1235 (2003)], are close to those of $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ of 2. However, in addition to the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that the ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of the uniaxial-stress-induced shift.

Cyclic cohomology of certain nuclear Fr\'echet and DF algebras - We give explicit formulae for the continuous Hochschild and cyclic homology and cohomology of certain topological algebras. To this end we show that, for a continuous morphism $\phi: \X\to \Y$ of complexes of complete nuclear $DF$-spaces, the isomorphism of cohomology groups $H^n(\phi): H^n(\X) \to H^n(\Y)$ is automatically topological. The continuous cyclic-type homology and cohomology are described up to topological isomorphism for the following classes of biprojective $\hat{\otimes}$-algebras: the tensor algebra $E \hat{\otimes} F$ generated by the duality $(E, F, < \cdot, \cdot >)$ for nuclear Fr\'echet spaces $E$ and $F$ or for nuclear $DF$-spaces $E$ and $F$; nuclear biprojective K\"{o}the algebras $\lambda(P)$ which are Fr\'echet spaces or $DF$-spaces; the algebra of distributions $\mathcal{E}^*(G)$ on a compact Lie group $G$.

The on-line shortest path problem under partial monitoring - The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along with simulation results are also presented.

Curvature estimates for Weingarten hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds - We prove curvature estimates for general curvature functions. As an application we show the existence of closed, strictly convex hypersurfaces with prescribed curvature $F$, where the defining cone of $F$ is $\C_+$. $F$ is only assumed to be monotone, symmetric, homogeneous of degree 1, concave and of class $C^{m,\al}$, $m\ge4$.

Almost sure functional central limit theorem for non-nestling random walk in random environment - We consider a non-nestling random walk in a product random environment. We assume an exponential moment for the step of the walk, uniformly in the environment. We prove an invariance principle (functional central limit theorem) under almost every environment for the centered and diffusively scaled walk. The main point behind the invariance principle is that the quenched mean of the walk behaves subdiffusively.

The Effect of Annealing Temperature on Statistical Properties of $WO_3$ Surface - We have studied the effect of annealing temperature on the statistical properties of $WO_3$ surface using atomic force microscopy techniques (AFM). We have applied both level crossing and structure function methods. Level crossing analysis indicates an optimum annealing temperature of around 400$^oC$ at which the effective area of the $WO_3$ thin film is maximum, whereas composition of the surface remains stoichiometric. The complexity of the height fluctuation of surfaces was characterized by roughness, roughness exponent and lateral size of surface features. We have found that there is a phase transition at around 400$^oC$ from one set to two sets of roughness parameters. This happens due to microstructural changes from amorphous to crystalline structure in the samples that has been already found experimentally.

Determination of Low-Energy Parameters of Neutron--Proton Scattering on the Basis of Modern Experimental Data from Partial-Wave Analyses - The triplet and singlet low-energy parameters in the effective-range expansion for neutron--proton scattering are determined by using the latest experimental data on respective phase shifts from the SAID nucleon--nucleon database. The results differ markedly from the analogous parameters obtained on the basis of the phase shifts of the Nijmegen group and contradict the parameter values that are presently used as experimental ones. The values found with the aid of the phase shifts from the SAID nucleon--nucleon database for the total cross section for the scattering of zero-energy neutrons by protons, $\sigma_{0}=20.426 $b, and the neutron--proton coherent scattering length, $f=-3.755 $fm, agree perfectly with the experimental cross-section values obtained by Houk, $\sigma_{0}=20.436\pm 0.023 $b, and experimental scattering-length values obtained by Houk and Wilson, $f=-3.756\pm 0.009 $fm, but they contradict cross-section values of $\sigma_{0}=20.491\pm 0.014 $b according to Dilg and coherent-scattering-length values of $f=-3.7409\pm 0.0011 $fm according to Koester and Nistler.

Simulation of Ultra High Energy Neutrino Interactions in Ice and Water - The CORSIKA program, usually used to simulate extensive cosmic ray air showers, has been adapted to work in a water or ice medium. The adapted CORSIKA code was used to simulate hadronic showers produced by neutrino interactions. The simulated showers have been used to study the spatial distribution of the deposited energy in the showers. This allows a more precise determination of the acoustic signals produced by ultra high energy neutrinos than has been possible previously. The properties of the acoustic signals generated by such showers are described.

The Measure for the Multiverse and the Probability for Inflation - We investigate the measure problem in the framework of inflationary cosmology. The measure of the history space is constructed and applied to inflation models. Using this measure, it is shown that the probability for the generalized single field slow roll inflation to last for $N$ e-folds is suppressed by a factor $\exp(-3N)$, and the probability for the generalized $n$-field slow roll inflation is suppressed by a much larger factor $\exp(-3nN)$. Some non-inflationary models such as the cyclic model do not suffer from this difficulty.

$B_s^0 \to \eta^{(\prime)} \eta^{(\prime)}$ decays in the pQCD approach - We calculate the CP averaged branching ratios and CP-violating asymmetries for $B_s^0 \to \eta \eta, \eta \eta^\prime$ and $\eta^\prime \eta^\prime$ decays in the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach here. The pQCD predictions for the CP-averaged branching ratios are $Br(B_s^0 \to \eta \eta) = \left (14.2^{+18.0}_{-7.5}) \times 10^{-6}$, $Br(B_s^0 \to \eta \eta^\prime)= \left (12.4 ^{+18.2}_{-7.0}) \times 10^{-6}$, and $Br(B_s^0 \to \eta^{\prime} \eta^{\prime}) = \left (9.2^{+15.3}_{-4.9}) \times 10^{-6}$, which agree well with those obtained by employing the QCD factorization approach and also be consistent with available experimental upper limits. The gluonic contributions are small in size: less than 7% for $B_s \to \eta \eta$ and $ \eta \eta^\prime$ decays, and around 18% for $B_s \to \eta' \eta'$ decay. The CP-violating asymmetries for three decays are very small: less than 3% in magnitude.

A neural network approach to ordinal regression - Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression. On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.

Controlling surface statistical properties using bias voltage: Atomic force microscopy and stochastic analysis - The effect of bias voltages on the statistical properties of rough surfaces has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique and its stochastic analysis. We have characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a rough surface by the stochastic parameters such as roughness exponent, level crossing, and drift and diffusion coefficients as a function of the applied bias voltage. It is shown that these statistical as well as microstructural parameters can also explain the macroscopic property of a surface. Furthermore, the tip convolution effect on the stochastic parameters has been examined.

Etched Glass Surfaces, Atomic Force Microscopy and Stochastic Analysis - The effect of etching time scale of glass surface on its statistical properties has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique. We have characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a etched surface by the stochastic parameters such as intermittency exponents, roughness, roughness exponents, drift and diffusion coefficients and find their variations in terms of the etching time.

Measurements of Single and Double Spin Asymmetry in \textit{pp} Elastic Scattering in the CNI Region with Polarized Hydrogen Gas Jet Target - Precise measurements of the single spin asymmetry, $A_N$ and the double spin asymmetry, $A_{NN}$, in proton-proton (\textit{pp}) elastic scattering in the region of four-momentum transfer squared $0.001 < -t < 0.032 ({\rm GeV}/c)^2$ have been performed using a polarized atomic hydrogen gas jet target and the RHIC polarized proton beam at 24 GeV/$c$ and 100 GeV/$c$. The polarized gaseous proton target allowed us to achieve the measurement of $A_{NN}$ in the CNI region for the first time. Our results of $A_N$ and $A_{NN}$ provide significant constraints to determine the magnitude of poorly known hadronic single and double spin-flip amplitudes at this energy.

Theta constants identities for Jacobians of cyclic 3-sheeted covers of the sphere and representations of the symmetric group - We find identities between theta constants with rational characteristics evaluated at period matrix of $R,$ a cyclic 3 sheeted cover of the sphere with $3k$ branch points $\lambda_1...\lambda_{3k}.$ These identities follow from Thomae formula \cite{BR}. This formula expresses powers of theta constants as polynomials in $\lambda_1...\lambda_{3k}.$ We apply the representation of the symmetric group to find relations between the polynomials and hence between the associated theta constants.

Topology of spaces of equivariant symplectic embeddings - We compute the homotopy type of the space of T^n-equivariant symplectic embeddings from the standard 2n-dimensional ball of some fixed radius into a 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifold M, and use this computation to define a Z-valued step function on the positive real line which is an invariant of the symplectic-toric type of M. We conclude with a discussion of the partially equivariant case of this result.

Toric symplectic ball packing - We define and solve the toric version of the symplectic ball packing problem, in the sense of listing all 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds which admit a perfect packing by balls embedded in a symplectic and torus equivariant fashion. In order to do this we first describe a problem in geometric-combinatorics which is equivalent to the toric symplectic ball packing problem. Then we solve this problem using arguments from Convex Geometry and Delzant theory. Applications to symplectic blowing-up are also presented, and some further questions are raised in the last section.

Anisotropic brane gravity with a confining potential - We consider an anisotropic brane world with Bianchi type I and V geometries where the mechanism of confining the matter on the brane is through the use of a confining potential. The resulting equations on the anisotropic brane are modified by an extra term that may be interpreted as the x-matter, providing a possible phenomenological explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We obtain the general solution of the field equations in an exact parametric form for both Bianchi type I and V space-times. In the special case of a Bianchi type I the solutions of the field equations are obtained in an exact analytic form. Finally, we study the behavior of the observationally important parameters.

Maximal ball packings of symplectic-toric manifolds - Let M be a symplectic-toric manifold of dimension at least four. This paper investigates the so called symplectic ball packing problem in the toral equivariant setting. We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings of M admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first author shows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density one packings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. In contrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there are uncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with a maximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysis of how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a given symplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds that are equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.

Controlled collisions of a single atom and ion guided by movable trapping potentials - We consider a system composed of a trapped atom and a trapped ion. The ion charge induces in the atom an electric dipole moment, which attracts it with an r^{-4} dependence at large distances. In the regime considered here, the characteristic range of the atom-ion interaction is comparable or larger than the characteristic size of the trapping potential, which excludes the application of the contact pseudopotential. The short-range part of the interaction is described in the framework of quantum-defect theory, by introducing some short-range parameters, which can be related to the s-wave scattering length. When the separation between traps is changed we observe trap-induced shape resonances between molecular bound states and vibrational states of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to quasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit confinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for short-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the effects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which occurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps. Finally, we show how the two types of resonances can be employed for quantum state control and spectroscopy of atom-ion molecules.

Counting BPS operators in N=4 SYM - The free field partition function for a generic U(N) gauge theory, where the fundamental fields transform in the adjoint representation, is analysed in terms of symmetric polynomial techniques. It is shown by these means how this is related to the cycle polynomial for the symmetric group and how the large N result may be easily recovered. Higher order corrections for finite N are also discussed in terms of symmetric group characters. For finite N, the partition function involving a single bosonic fundamental field is recovered and explicit counting of multi-trace quarter BPS operators in free \N=4 super Yang Mills discussed, including a general result for large N. The partition function for BPS operators in the chiral ring of \N=4 super Yang Mills is analysed in terms of plane partitions. Asymptotic counting of BPS primary operators with differing R-symmetry charges is discussed in both free \N=4 super Yang Mills and in the chiral ring. Also, general and explicit expressions are derived for SU(2) gauge theory partition functions, when the fundamental fields transform in the adjoint, for free field theory.

Symplectic homology, autonomous Hamiltonians, and Morse-Bott moduli spaces - We define Floer homology for a time-independent, or autonomous Hamiltonian on a symplectic manifold with contact type boundary, under the assumption that its 1-periodic orbits are transversally nondegenerate. Our construction is based on Morse-Bott techniques for Floer trajectories. Our main motivation is to understand the relationship between linearized contact homology of a fillable contact manifold and symplectic homology of its filling.

Recent Results on Thermal Casimir Force between Dielectrics and Related Problems - We review recent results obtained in the physics of the thermal Casimir force acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus, is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion, the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all present experiments.

Higher dimensional conundra - We study asymptotics of various Euclidean geometric phenomena as the dimension tend to infinity.

Entangling and disentangling capacities of nonlocal maps - Entangling and disentangling capacities are the key manifestation of the nonlocal content of a quantum operation. A lot of effort has been put recently into investigating (dis)entangling capacities of unitary operations, but very little is known about capacities of non-unitary operations. Here we investigate (dis)entangling capacities of unital CPTP maps acting on two qubits.

On the Kolmogorov-Chaitin Complexity for short sequences - A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter, for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences. Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.

The redshift and geometrical aspect of photons - The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the same geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have length contraction effect.

Cool Stars in Hot Places - During the last three decades, evidence has mounted that star and planet formation is not an isolated process, but is influenced by current and previous generations of stars. Although cool stars form in a range of environments, from isolated globules to rich embedded clusters, the influences of other stars on cool star and planet formation may be most significant in embedded clusters, where hundreds to thousands of cool stars form in close proximity to OB stars. At the cool stars 14 meeting, a splinter session was convened to discuss the role of environment in the formation of cool stars and planetary systems; with an emphasis on the ``hot'' environment found in rich clusters. We review here the basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have organized this contribution into five basic questions: what is the typical environment of cool star formation, what role do hot star play in cool star formation, what role does environment play in planet formation, what is the role of hot star winds and supernovae, and what was the formation environment of the Sun? The intention is to review progress made in addressing each question, and to underscore areas of agreement and contention.

Heights and metrics with logarithmic singularities - We prove lower bound and finiteness properties for arakelovian heights with respect to pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles. These heights were introduced by Burgos, Kramer and K\"uhn, in their extension of the arithmetic intersection theory of Gillet and Soul\'e, aimed to deal with hermitian vector bundles equipped with metrics admitting suitable logarithmic singularities. Our results generalize the corresponding properties for the heights of Bost-Gillet-Soul\'e, as well as the properties established by Faltings for heights of points attached to hermitian line bundles whose metrics have logarithmic singularities. We also discuss various geometric constructions where such pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles naturally arise.

Bar-Halo Friction in Galaxies III: Particle Number Requirements for Simulations - The question whether the dark matter halo density in the centers of galaxies could be changed through interactions with a rotating bar in the baryonic disk is of considerable current interest. While N-body simulations have been used to address this question, it has also been claimed that results from such simulations cannot be trusted. Based on a perturbative treatment of resonant exchanges between orbits and a rotating perturbation, Weinberg & Katz contend that N-body simulations of this process will not reveal the continuum result unless many more than the usual numbers of particles are employed. Here I report a study designed to examine their contention, finding results that show no dependence on the number of particles over the range usually employed up to that advocated by these authors. I show that my results are independent of all numerical parameters, and that field methods perform equally with grid methods in this respect. I also identify the reasons that the required particle number suggested by Weinberg & Katz is excessive.

Anisotropic quasiparticle renormalization in Na0.73CoO2: role of inter-orbital interactions and magnetic correlations - We report an angular resolved photoemission study of Na0.73CoO2 where it is found that the renormalization of the quasiparticle (QP) dispersion changes dramatically upon a rotation from GM to GK. The comparison of the experimental data to the calculated band structure reveals that the QP-renormalization is most pronounced along the GK-direction, while it is significantly weaker along the GM-direction. We discuss the observed anisotropy in terms of multiorbital effects and point out the relevance of magnetic correlations for the band structure of Na0.73CoO2.

Charmless Three-body Decays of B Mesons - Charmless 3-body decays of B mesons are studied in the framework of the factorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\to P_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory (HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in the exponential form $e^{-\alpha_{NR}} p_B\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT results are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\to 0$. In addition, we have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the Breit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of $K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the data within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\to K^+K^-K_{S}$ decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective $\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the latter. (iii) For $B\to K\pi\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant contributions in $K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\bar K^0\pi^+\pi^-$ modes, in agreement with the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result.

Electrical transport properties of polar heterointerface between KTaO3 and SrTiO3 - Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating perovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3 film deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated (100) SrTiO3 substrate. The resulting (KO)1-(TiO2)0 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according to formal valences of K (1+) and Ti (4+). We observed electrical conductivity and mobility in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in electron-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge carriers in KTaO3/SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The result is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite oxide hetero-interfaces.

The Angular Separation of the Components of the Cepheid AW Per - The 6.4 day classical Cepheid AW Per is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 40 years. Analyzing the centroids of HST/STIS spectra obtained in November 2001, we have determined the angular separation of the binary system. Although we currently have spatially resolved data for a single epoch in the orbit, the success of our approach opens the possibility of determining the inclination, sini, for the system if the measurements are repeated at additional epochs. Since the system is potentially a double lined spectroscopic binary, the combination of spectroscopic orbits for both components and the visual orbit would give the distance to the system and the masses of its components, thereby providing a direct measurement of a Cepheid mass.

Transverse field effect in graphene ribbons - It is shown that a graphene ribbon, a ballistic strip of carbon monolayer, may serve as a quantum wire whose electronic properties can be continuously and reversibly controlled by an externally applied transverse voltage. The electron bands of armchair-edge ribbons undergo dramatic transformations: The Fermi surface fractures, Fermi velocity and effective mass change sign, and excitation gaps are reduced by the transverse field. These effects are manifest in the conductance plateaus, van Hove singularities, thermopower, and activated transport. The control over one-dimensional bands may help enhance effects of electron correlations, and be utilized in device applications.

Domain Switching Kinetics in Disordered Ferroelectric Thin Films - We investigated domain kinetics by measuring the polarization switching behaviors of polycrystalline Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_{3}$ films, which are widely used in ferroelectric memory devices. Their switching behaviors at various electric fields and temperatures could be explained by assuming the Lorentzian distribution of domain switching times. We viewed the switching process under an electric field as a motion of the ferroelectric domain through a random medium, and we showed that the local field variation due to dipole defects at domain pinning sites could explain the intriguing distribution.

Geometry of Time, Axiom of Choice and Neuro-Biological Quantum Zeno Effect - Role of axiom of choice in quantum measurement is highlighted by suggesting that the conscious observer chooses the outcome from a mixed state. Further, in a periodically repeating universe, these outcomes must be pre-recorded within the non-physical conscious observers, which precludes free will. Free will however exists in a universe with open time, It is suggested that psychology's binding problem is connected with Cantor's original definition of set. Influence of consciousness on material outcome through quantum processes is discussed and interesting constraints derived. For example, it is predicted that quantum mechanical brain states should get frozen if monitored at sufficiently small space-time intervals - a neuro-biological version of the so called quantum zeno effect, which has been verified in domain of micro-physics. Existence of a very small micro-mini-black-hole in brain is predicted as a space-time structural interface between consciousness and brain, whose vaporization explains mass-loss reported in weighing experiments, conducting during the moments of death.

Probing the Structure of Gamma-Ray Burst Jets with Steep Decay Phase of their Early X-ray Afterglows - We show that the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be investigated with the tail emission of the prompt GRB. The tail emission which we consider is identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed by the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive, for the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail emission for various jet models. The new definitions of the zero of time and the time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for fitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which is useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB jet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially, if we observe events whose decay index is less than about 2, both the uniform and the Gaussian jet models will be disfavored according to our simulation study.

Black Hole's Life at colliders - In the series of papers by Ida, Oda and Park, the complete description of Hawking radiation to the brane localized Standard Model fields from mini black holes in the low energy gravity scenarios are obtained. Here we briefly review what we have learned in those papers.

Working with 2s and 3s - We establish an equivalent condition to the validity of the Collatz conjecture, using elementary methods. We derive some conclusions and show several examples of our results. We also offer a variety of exercises, problems and conjectures.

Dark energy, gravitation and supernovae - The discovery of the acceleration of the rate of expansion of the Universe fosters new explorations of the behavior of gravitation theories in the cosmological context. Either the GR framework is valid but a cosmic component with a negative equation of state is dominating the energy--matter contents or the Universe is better described at large by a theory that departs from GR. In this review we address theoretical alternatives that have been explored through supernovae.

Decartes' Perfect Lens - We give a new, elementary, purely analytical development of \textsc{Descartes}' theorem that a smooth connected surface is a perfect focusing lens if and only if it is a connected subset of the ovoid obtained by revolving a cartesian oval around its axis of symmetry.

Deformation of Dijkgraaf-Vafa Relation via Spontaneously Broken N=2 Supersymmetry - It is known that the fermionic shift symmetry of the N=1, U(N) gauge model with a superpotential of an adjoint chiral superfield is replaced by the second (spontaneously broken) supersymmetry in the N=2, U(N) gauge model with a prepotential and Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters. Based on a diagrammatic analysis, we demonstrate how the well-known form of the effective superpotential in the former model is modified in the latter. A set of two equations on the one-point functions stating the Konishi anomaly is modified accordingly.

Scaling p_T distributions for p and \bar{p} produced in Au+Au collisions at RHIC - With the experimental data from STAR and PHENIX on the centrality dependence of the $p_T$ spectra of protons and anti-protons produced at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV, we show that for protons and anti-protons there exists a scaling distribution independent of the colliding centrality. The scaling functions can also describe data from BRAHMS for both proton and anti-proton spectra at $y=2.2$ and 3.2. The scaling behaviors are shown to be incompatible with the usual string fragmentation scenario for particle production.

SiO maser observations of a wide dust-temperature range sample - We present the results of SiO line observations of a sample of known SiO maser sources covering a wide dust-temperature range. The aim of the present research is to investigate the causes of the correlation between infrared colors and SiO maser intensity ratios among different transition lines. We observed in total 75 SiO maser sources with the Nobeyama 45m telescope quasi-simultaneously in the SiO J=1-0 v=0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and J=2-1 v=1, 2 lines. We also observed the sample in the 29SiO J=1-0 v=0 and J=2-1 v=0, and 30SiO J=1-0 v=0 lines, and the H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) line. As reported in previous papers, we confirmed that the intensity ratios of the SiO J=1-0 v=2 to v=1 lines clearly correlate with infrared colors. In addition, we found possible correlation between infrared colors and the intensity ratios of the SiO J=1-0 v=3 to v=1&2 lines.

Excitation Spectrum Gap and Spin-Wave Stiffness of XXZ Heisenberg Chains: Global Renormalization-Group Calculation - The anisotropic XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain is studied using renormalization-group theory. The specific heats and nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlations are calculated thoughout the entire temperature and anisotropy ranges in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions, obtaining a global description and quantitative results. We obtain, for all anisotropies, the antiferromagnetic spin-liquid spin-wave velocity and the Isinglike ferromagnetic excitation spectrum gap, exhibiting the spin-wave to spinon crossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The in-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic correlation in the out-of-plane s_i^z component, at higher temperatures in the antiferromagnetic XXZ chain, dominantly at low temperatures in the ferromagnetic XXZ chain, and, in-between, at all temperatures in the XY chain. We find that the converse effect also occurs in the antiferromagnetic XXZ chain: an antiferromagnetic s_i^z s_j^z interaction induces a correlation in the s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the antiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to anisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the isotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY) anisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and temperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.

Precise Control of Band Filling in NaxCoO2 - Electronic properties of the sodium cobaltate NaxCoO2 are systematically studied through a precise control of band filling. Resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements are carried out on a series of high-quality polycrystalline samples prepared at 200 C with Na content in a wide range of 0.35 =< x =< 0.70. It is found that dramatic changes in electronic properties take place at a critical Na concentration x* that lies between 0.58 and 0.59, which separates a Pauli paramagnetic and a Curie-Weiss metals. It is suggested that at x* the Fermi level touches the bottom of the a1g band at the gamma point, leading to a crucial change in the density of states across x* and the emergence of a small electron pocket around the gamma point for x > x*.

Observations on degenerate saddle point problems - We investigate degenerate saddle point problems, which can be viewed as limit cases of standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in coefficients. We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the degeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The LBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the problem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The generalized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other assumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the positiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several equivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation for research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of the jumps. Such problems appear, e.g., in numerical simulations of composite materials made of components with contrasting properties.

Expected Planets in Globular Clusters - We argue that all transient searches for planets in globular clusters have a very low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do not reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system properties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is considered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity, respectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems at high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2, where M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is only at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it is still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular clusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at orbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on the role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in globular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in forming low mass white dwarfs.

Fast paths in large-scale dynamic road networks - Efficiently computing fast paths in large scale dynamic road networks (where dynamic traffic information is known over a part of the network) is a practical problem faced by several traffic information service providers who wish to offer a realistic fast path computation to GPS terminal enabled vehicles. The heuristic solution method we propose is based on a highway hierarchy-based shortest path algorithm for static large-scale networks; we maintain a static highway hierarchy and perform each query on the dynamically evaluated network.

Optical Zeno Gate: Bounds for Fault Tolerant Operation - In principle the Zeno effect controlled-sign gate of Franson et al's (PRA 70, 062302, 2004) is a deterministic two-qubit optical gate. However, when realistic values of photon loss are considered its fidelity is significantly reduced. Here we consider the use of measurement based quantum processing techniques to enhance the operation of the Zeno gate. With the help of quantum teleportation, we show that it is possible to achieve a Zeno CNOT gate (GC-Zeno gate) that gives (near) unit fidelity and moderate probability of success of 0.76 with a one-photon to two-photon transmission ratio $\kappa=10^4$. We include some mode-mismatch effects and estimate the bounds on the mode overlap and $\kappa$ for which fault tolerant operation would be possible.

Differential Diversity Reception of MDPSK over Independent Rayleigh Channels with Nonidentical Branch Statistics and Asymmetric Fading Spectrum - This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth, but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic. Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit, closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a function of various system parameters.

Bulk viscosity of superfluid neutron stars - The hydrodynamics, describing dynamical effects in superfluid neutron stars, essentially differs from the standard one-fluid hydrodynamics. In particular, we have four bulk viscosity coefficients in the theory instead of one. In this paper we calculate these coefficients, for the first time, assuming they are due to non-equilibrium beta-processes (such as modified or direct Urca process). The results of our analysis are used to estimate characteristic damping times of sound waves in superfluid neutron stars. It is demonstrated that all four bulk viscosity coefficients lead to comparable dissipation of sound waves and should be considered on the same footing.

A Faddeev Calculation for Pentaquark $\Theta^+$ in Diquark Picture with Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Type Interaction - A Bethe-Salpeter-Faddeev (BSF) calculation is performed for the pentaquark $\Theta^+$ in the diquark picture of Jaffe and Wilczek in which $\Theta^+$ is a diquark-diquark-${\bar s}$ three-body system. Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is used to calculate the lowest order diagrams in the two-body scatterings of ${\bar s}D$ and $D D$. With the use of coupling constants determined from the meson sector, we find that ${\bar s}D$ interaction is attractive while $DD$ interaction is repulsive, and there is no bound $\frac 12^+$ pentaquark state. A bound pentaquark $\Theta^+$ can only be obtained with unphysically strong vector mesonic coupling constants.

Shell-mediated tunnelling between (anti-)de Sitter vacua - We give an extensive study of the tunnelling between arbitrary (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes separated by an infinitesimally thin relativistic shell in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. In particular, we find analytically an exact expression for the tunnelling amplitude. The detailed spacetime structures that can arise are discussed, together with an effective "regularization scheme" for "before tunnelling" configurations.

Markov basis and Groebner basis of Segre-Veronese configuration for testing independence in group-wise selections - We consider testing independence in group-wise selections with some restrictions on combinations of choices. We present models for frequency data of selections for which it is easy to perform conditional tests by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. When the restrictions on the combinations can be described in terms of a Segre-Veronese configuration, an explicit form of a Gr\"obner basis consisting of moves of degree two is readily available for performing a Markov chain. We illustrate our setting with the National Center Test for university entrance examinations in Japan. We also apply our method to testing independence hypotheses involving genotypes at more than one locus or haplotypes of alleles on the same chromosome.

New Terms for the Compact Form of Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian - The compact form of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian is a reformulation of its original form and is expressed in terms of chiral rotated electroweak gauge fields, which is crucial for relating the information of underlying theories to the coefficients of the low-energy effective Lagrangian. However the compact form obtained in previous works is not complete. In this letter we add several new chiral invariant terms to it and discuss the contributions of these terms to the original electroweak chiral Lagrangian.

Seeing maximum entropy from the principle of virtual work - We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the status of fundamental physics law.

Microlocal Asymptotic Analysis in Algebras of Generalized Functions - We introduce a new type of local and microlocal asymptotic analysis in algebras of generalized functions, based on the presheaf properties of those algebras and on the properties of their elements with respect to a regularizing parameter. Contrary to the more classical frequential analysis based on the Fourier transform, we can describe a singular asymptotic spectrum which has good properties with respect to nonlinear operations. In this spirit we give several examples of propagation of singularities through nonlinear operators.

1H-NMR Study on the Magnetic Order in the Mixture of Two Spin Gap Systems (CH3)2CHNH3CuCl3 and (CH3)2CHNH3CuBr3 - The antiferromagnetic ordering in the solid-solution of the two spin-gap systems (CH3)2CHNH3CuCl3 and (CH3)2CHNH3CuBr3 has been investigated by 1H-NMR. The sample with the Cl-content ratio x=0.85 showed a clear splitting in spectra below TN=13.5 K, where the spin-lattice relaxation rate T1-1 showed a diverging behavior. The critical exponent of the temperature dependence of the hyperfine field is found to be 0.33.

Instanton Induced Neutrino Majorana Masses in CFT Orientifolds with MSSM-like spectra - Recently it has been shown that string instanton effects may give rise to neutrino Majorana masses in certain classes of semi-realistic string compactifications. In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric MSSM-like Type II Gepner orientifold constructions admitting boundary states associated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L- and/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane instantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only instantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to contribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of fluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold compactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries to generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with MSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the required zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other hand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner model $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged non-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A few more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints on the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting property that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of the neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.

The solutions of the N-identical quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with each other through the harmonic potential - This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to some mistakes

Asymmetry of in-medium rho-mesons as a signature of Cherenkov effects - Cherenkov gluons may be responsible for the asymmetry of dilepton mass spectra near rho-meson observed in experiment. They can be produced only in the low-mass wing of the resonance. Therefore the dilepton mass spectra are flattened there and their peak is slightly shifted to lower masses compared with the in-vacuum rho-meson mass. This feature must be common for all resonances.

Superconductivity and magnetic order in CeRhIn$_{5}$; spectra of coexistence - We discuss the fixed-point Hamiltonian and the spectrum of excitations of a quasi-bidimensional electronic system supporting simultaneously antiferromamagnetic ordering and superconductivity. The coexistence of these two order parameters in a single phase is possible because the magnetic order is linked to the formation of a spin density wave, and its order parameter is not associated to a spectral gap but to an energy shift of the paramagnetic bands. This peculiarity entails several distinct features in the phase diagram and the spectral properties of the model, which may have been observed in CeRhIn$_5$. Apart from the coexistence, we find an abrupt suppression of the spin density wave when the superconducting and magnetic ordering temperatures are equal. The divergence of the cyclotron mass extracted from de Haas-van Alphen experiments is also analyzed in the same framework.

B-pairs and (phi,Gamma)-modules - Main change from v1 : theorem C has been modified, see remark 3.1.7 (2). We study the category of B-pairs (W_e,W_dR^+) where W_e is a free B_cris^{phi=1}-module with a semilinear and continuous action of G_K and where W_dR^+ is a G_K-stable B_dR^+ -lattice in B_dR \otimes W_e. This category contains the category of p-adic representations and is naturally equivalent to the category of all (phi,Gamma)-modules over the Robba ring.

Vacuum Energy and Renormalization on the Edge - The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

Gauge Mediation in String Theory - We show that a large class of phenomenologically viable models for gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking based on meta-stable vacua can be realized in local Calabi-Yau compactifications of string theory.

Higher harmonics increase LISA's mass reach for supermassive black holes - Current expectations on the signal to noise ratios and masses of supermassive black holes which the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can observe are based on using in matched filtering only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral waveform at twice the orbital frequency. Other harmonics will affect the signal-to-noise ratio of systems currently believed to be observable by LISA. More significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would mean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\it not} visible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\sim 10^8M_\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA will be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total mass $\sim 10^8 M_\odot (10^9M_\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency cut-off of $10^{-4}{\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\sim 60$ $(\sim 30)$ at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the astrophysical viewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this mass range is quite strong and binaries containing such supermassive black holes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the dominant harmonic.

EPR, Bell, Schrodinger's cat, and the Monty Hall Paradox - The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a short pedagogical explanation why "quantum collapse" is not a metaphysical event, by pointing out the analogy with a "classical collapse" which is associated with the Monty Hall Paradox.

Extended Comment on "One-Range Addition Theorems for Coulomb Interaction Potential and Its Derivatives" by I. I. Guseinov (Chem. Phys. Vol. 309 (2005), pp. 209 - 213) - Addition theorems are principal tools that express a function $f (\bm{r} \pm \bm{r}')$ in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either $\bm{r}$ or $\bm{r}'$. The best known example of such an addition theorem is the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to 0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential $\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist. Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

Representative Ensembles in Statistical Mechanics - The notion of representative statistical ensembles, correctly representing statistical systems, is strictly formulated. This notion allows for a proper description of statistical systems, avoiding inconsistencies in theory. As an illustration, a Bose-condensed system is considered. It is shown that a self-consistent treatment of the latter, using a representative ensemble, always yields a conserving and gapless theory.

Bouncing Universe with Quintom Matter - The bouncing universe provides a possible solution to the Big Bang singularity problem. In this paper we study the bouncing solution in the universe dominated by the Quintom matter with an equation of state (EoS) crossing the cosmological constant boundary. We will show explicitly the analytical and numerical bouncing solutions in three types of models for the Quintom matter with an phenomenological EoS, the two scalar fields and a scalar field with a modified Born-Infeld action.

On the weight structure of cyclic codes over $GF(q)$, $q>2$ - The interrelation between the cyclic structure of an ideal, i.e., a cyclic code over Galois field $GF(q)$, $q>2$, and its classes of proportional elements is considered. This relation is used in order to define the code's weight structure. The equidistance conditions of irreducible nonprimitive codes over GF(q) are given. Besides that, the minimum distance for some class of nonprimitive cyclic codes is found.

Simplifying additivity problems using direct sum constructions - We study the additivity problems for the classical capacity of quantum channels, the minimal output entropy and its convex closure. We show for each of them that additivity for arbitrary pairs of channels holds iff it holds for arbitrary equal pairs, which in turn can be taken to be unital. In a similar sense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex entanglement monotone. The implications are obtained by considering direct sums of channels (or states) for which we show how to obtain several information theoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple and general tool for lifting additivity results.

Modulational instability in nonlocal Kerr-type media with random parameters - Modulational instability of continuous waves in nonlocal focusing and defocusing Kerr media with stochastically varying diffraction (dispersion) and nonlinearity coefficients is studied both analytically and numerically. It is shown that nonlocality with the sign-definite Fourier images of the medium response functions suppresses considerably the growth rate peak and bandwidth of instability caused by stochasticity. Contrary, nonlocality can enhance modulational instability growth for a response function with negative-sign bands.

SUBARU HDS Observations of a Balmer-Dominated Shock in Tycho's Supernova Remnant - We present an Ha spectral observation of a Balmer-dominated shock on the eastern side of Tycho's supernova remnant using the Subaru Telescope. Utilizing the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS), we measure the spatial variation of the line profile between preshock and postshock gas. Our observation clearly shows a broadening and centroid shift of the narrow-component postshock Ha line relative to the Ha emission from the preshock gas. The observation supports the existence of a thin precursor where gas is heated and accelerated ahead of the shock. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the emission ahead of the Balmer filament shows a gradual gradient in the Ha intensity and line width ahead of the shock. We propose that this region (~10^16 cm) is likely to be the spatially resolved precursor. The line width increases from ~30 up to ~45 km/s, and its central velocity shows a redshift of ~5 km/s across the shock front. The characteristics of the precursor are consistent with a cosmic-ray precursor, although the possibility of a fast neutral precursor is not ruled out.

Orbits of tori extended by finite groups and their polynomial hulls: the case of connected complex orbits - Let $V$ be a complex linear space, $G\subset\GL(V)$ be a compact group. We consider the problem of description of polynomial hulls $\wh{Gv}$ for orbits $Gv$, $v\in V$, assuming that the identity component of $G$ is a torus $T$. The paper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion $Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is true for a generic $v\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in $T^\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\clos T^\bbC v$ by a finite collection of inequalities of the type $\abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\leq c$. In particular, this is true for $Gv$. If powers in the monomials are independent of $v$, $Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, and either the center of $G$ is finite or $T^\bbC$ has an open orbit, then the space $V$ and the group $G$ are products of standard ones; the latter means that $G=S_nT$, where $S_n$ is the group of all permutations of coordinates and $T$ is either $\bbT^n$ or $\SU(n)\cap\bbT^n$, where $\bbT^n$ is the torus of all diagonal matrices in $\rU(n)$. The paper also contains a description of polynomial hulls for orbits of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains. This result is already known, but we formulate it in a different form and supply with a shorter proof.

Formation of a sonic horizon in isotropically expanding Bose-Einstein condensates - We propose a simple experiment to create a sonic horizon in isotropically trapped cold atoms within currently available experimental techniques. Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach resonance in real experiments. The sonic horizon is shown to be quasi-static for sufficiently strong interaction or large number of atoms. The characteristic temperature that is associated with particle emission from the horizon, which corresponds to the Hawking temperature in an ideal situation, is estimated to be a few nK.

Zero-temperature resistive transition in Josephson-junction arrays at irrational frustration - We use a driven Monte Carlo dynamics in the phase representation to determine the linear resistivity and current-voltage scaling of a two-dimensional Josephson-junction array at an irrational flux quantum per plaquette. The results are consistent with a phase-coherence transition scenario where the critical temperature vanishes. The linear resistivity is nonzero at any finite temperatures but nonlinear behavior sets in at a temperature-dependent crossover current determined by the thermal critical exponent. From a dynamic scaling analysis we determine this critical exponent and the thermally activated behavior of the linear resistivity. The results are in agreement with earlier calculations using the resistively shunted-junction model for the dynamics of the array. The linear resistivity behavior is consistent with some experimental results on arrays of superconducting grains but not on wire networks, which we argue have been obtained in a current regime above the crossover current.

Protostellar clusters in intermediate-mass (IM) star forming regions - The transition between the low density groups of T Tauri stars and the high density clusters around massive stars occurs in the intermediate-mass (IM) range (M$_*$$\sim$2--8 M$_\odot$). High spatial resolution studies of IM young stellar objects (YSO) can provide important clues to understand the clustering in massive star forming regions. Aims: Our aim is to search for clustering in IM Class 0 protostars. The high spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the new A configuration of the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) allow us to study the clustering in these nearby objects. Methods: We have imaged three IM Class 0 protostars (Serpens-FIRS 1, IC 1396 N, CB 3) in the continuum at 3.3 and 1.3mm using the PdBI. The sources have been selected with different luminosity to investigate the dependence of the clustering process on the luminosity of the source. Results: Only one millimeter (mm) source is detected towards the low luminosity source Serpens--FIRS 1. Towards CB 3 and IC1396 N, we detect two compact sources separated by $\sim$0.05 pc. The 1.3mm image of IC 1396 N, which provides the highest spatial resolution, reveal that one of these cores is splitted in, at least, three individual sources.

The Epps effect revisited - We analyse the dependence of stock return cross-correlations on the sampling frequency of the data known as the Epps effect: For high resolution data the cross-correlations are significantly smaller than their asymptotic value as observed on daily data. The former description implies that changing trading frequency should alter the characteristic time of the phenomenon. This is not true for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity. The latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected to the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time scale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description of the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After testing our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify our analytical results by fitting the Epps curves of real world data.

Transitive powers of Young-Jucys-Murphy elements are central - Although powers of the Young-Jucys-Murphya elements X_i = (1 i) + ... +(i-1 i), i = 1, ..., n, in the symmetric group S_n acting on {1, ...,n} do not lie in the centre of the group algebra of S_n, we show that transitive powers, namely the sum of the contributions from elements that act transitively on {1, >...,n}, are central. We determine the coefficients, which we call star factorization numbers, that occur in the resolution of transitive powers with respect to the class basis of the centre of S_n, and show that they have a polynomiality property. These centrality and polynomiality properties have seemingly unrelated consequences. First, they answer a question raised by Pak about reduced decompositions; second, they explain and extend the beautiful symmetry result discovered by Irving and Rattan; and thirdly, we relate the polynomiality to an existing polynomiality result for a class of double Hurwitz numbers associated with branched covers of the sphere, which therefore suggests that there may be an ELSV-type formula associated with the star factorization numbers.

On the S_n-module structure of the noncommutative harmonics - Using a noncommutative analog of Chevalley's decomposition of polynomials into symmetric polynomials times coinvariants due to Bergeron, Reutenauer, Rosas, and Zabrocki we compute the graded Frobenius series for their two sets of noncommutative harmonics with respect to the left action of the symmetric group (acting on variables). We use these results to derive the Frobenius series for the enveloping algebra of the derived free Lie algebra in n variables.

Spectral analysis for convolution operators on locally compact groups - We consider operators $H_\mu$ of convolution with measures $\mu$ on locally compact groups. We characterize the spectrum of $H_\mu$ by constructing auxiliary operators whose kernel contain the pure point and singular subspaces of $H_\mu$, respectively. The proofs rely on commutator methods.

Spin Dynamics Of $qqq$ Wave Function On Light Front In High Momentum Limit Of QCD : Role Of $qqq$ Force - The contribution of a spin-rich $qqq$ force (in conjunction with pairwise $qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked out in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be ignored, so that the dominant effect is $Coulombic$. A distinctive feature of this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram. The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel) formulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these ingredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\phi$ receives well-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a $negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$ which is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic singularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a spin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature. The potentially crucial role of this interesting effect vis-a-vis the so-called `spin anomaly' of the proton, is a subject of considerable physical interest.

On the induction of the four-dimensional Lorentz-breaking non-Abelian Chern-Simons action - A four-dimensional Lorentz-breaking non-Abelian Chern-Simons like action is generated as a one-loop perturbative correction via an appropriate Lorentz-breaking coupling of the non-Abelian gauge field to the spinor field. This term is shown to be regularization dependent but nevertheless it can be found unambiguously in different regularization schemes at zero and finite temperature.

Neutrino Astronomy with High Spatial Resolution is Already Existing - By basing on observations of skeletal structures of the Sun and assuming that some of them are located inside of star, and also that a filamentary (linear) matter (whose a model earlier was put forward by B.U. Rodionov) is in basis of these internal structures the author consider possible processes of images formation of these structures inside the Sun and theirs coming out into space and also gives an elementary estimations of its parameters, which allow: i) to form their images in a flux of electronic neutrinos; ii) to carry out these images from within of the Sun into space; iii) to develop these images in form of a concomitant flux of soft x-ray, which next is recorded by telescope of soft x-ray. It is supposed the processes considered here, actually, can be accepted as future base of neutrino astronomy with high spatial resolution.

Analysis of $\Omega_c^*(css)$ and $\Omega_b^*(bss)$ with QCD sum rules - In this article, we calculate the masses and residues of the heavy baryons $\Omega_c^*(css)$ and $\Omega_b^*(bss)$ with spin-parity ${3/2}^+$ with the QCD sum rules. The numerical values are compatible with experimental data and other theoretical estimations.

The dependence of the estimated luminosities of ULX on spectral models - Data from {\it Chandra} observations of thirty nearby galaxies were analyzed and 365 X-ray point sources were chosen whose spectra were not contaminated by excessive diffuse emission and not affected by photon pile up. The spectra of these sources were fitted using two spectral models (an absorbed power-law and a disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the spectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function depends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $> 10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\sim 80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk temperature $\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\Gamma \sim 2$) with those of the lower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known background AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed $10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The spectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black body model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct spectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and hence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures $\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk temperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they harbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\sim 0.5$ times their Eddington Luminosity. The radiative mechanism for hard ELX, seems to be Inverse Comptonization, which in contrast to standard black holes systems, is probably saturated.

Evidence for Symplectic Symmetry in Ab Initio No-Core Shell Model Results for Light Nuclei - Clear evidence for symplectic symmetry in low-lying states of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O is reported. Eigenstates of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, determined within the framework of the no-core shell model using the JISP16 $NN$ realistic interaction, typically project at the 85-90% level onto a few of the most deformed symplectic basis states that span only a small fraction of the full model space. The results are nearly independent of whether the bare or renormalized effective interactions are used in the analysis. The outcome confirms Elliott's \SU{3} model which underpins the symplectic scheme, and above all, points to the relevance of a symplectic no-core shell model that can reproduce experimental B(E2) values without effective charges as well as deformed spatial modes associated with clustering phenomena in nuclei.

Spinning Strings, Black Holes and Stable Closed Timelike Geodesics - The existence and stability under linear perturbation of closed timelike curves in the spacetime associated to Schwarzschild black hole pierced by a spinning string are studied. Due to the superposition of the black hole, we find that the spinning string spacetime is deformed in such a way to allow the existence of closed timelike geodesics.

On spherically symmetrical accretion in fractal media - We use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic accretion in fractal media. The fractional continuous medium model allows the generalization of the equations of balance of mass density and momentum density. These make it possible to consider the general case of spherical hydrodynamic accretion onto a gravitating mass embedded in a fractal medium. The general nature of the solution is similar to the "Bondi solution", but the accretion rate may vary substantially and the dependence on central mass may change significantly depending on dimensionality of the fractal medium. The theory shows consistency with the observational data and numerical simulation results for the particular case of accretion onto pre-main-sequence stars.

QCD in One Dimension at Nonzero Chemical Potential - Using an integration formula recently derived by Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer, we calculate the expectation value of the phase factor of the fermion determinant for the staggered lattice QCD action in one dimension. We show that the chemical potential can be absorbed into the quark masses; the theory is in the same chiral symmetry class as QCD in three dimensions at zero chemical potential. In the limit of a large number of colors and fixed number of lattice points, chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously, and our results are in agreement with expressions based on a chiral Lagrangian. In this limit, the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are correlated according to random matrix theory for QCD in three dimensions. The discontinuity of the chiral condensate is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula recently discovered for QCD in four dimensions at nonzero chemical potential. The effect of temperature on the average phase factor is discussed in a schematic random matrix model.

Can GLAST detect gamma-rays from the extended radio features of radio galaxies? - A few FRI radio galaxies were detected at GeV gamma-rays with CGRO EGRET, with peroperties suggesting that the gamma-ray flux originates from the core. Here we discuss the possibility that the extended radio features of radio galaxies could be detected with the LAT, focusing on the particularly promising case of the nearby giant radio galaxy Fornax A.

The VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars: Wind properties and evolution of hot massive stars in the LMC - [Abridged] We have studied the optical spectra of 28 O- and early B-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which are associated with the young star-forming region N11. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated fitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the genetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 and LH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation scenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample contains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be ~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs and giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly (or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be intermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and comparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good agreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) < 6.1.

Identification of Absorption Features in an Extrasolar Planet Atmosphere - Water absorption is identified in the atmosphere of HD209458b by comparing models for the planet's transmitted spectrum to recent, multi-wavelength, eclipse-depth measurements (from 0.3 to 1 microns) published by Knutson et al. (2007). A cloud-free model which includes solar abundances, rainout of condensates, and photoionization of sodium and potassium is in good agreement with the entire set of eclipse-depth measurements from the ultraviolet to near-infrared. Constraints are placed on condensate removal by gravitational settling, the bulk metallicity, and the redistribution of absorbed stellar flux. Comparisons are also made to the Charbonneau et al. (2002) sodium measurements.

Strange Nucleon Form Factors from $ep$ and $\nu p$ Elastic Scattering - The recent parity-violating $ep$ forward-scattering elastic asymmetry data from Jefferson Lab (HAPPEx and G0), when combined with the $\nu p$ elastic cross section data from Brookhaven (E734), permit an extraction of the strangeness contribution to the vector and axial nucleon form factors for momentum transfers in the range $0.45 < Q^2 < 1.0$ GeV$^2$. These results, combined with the recent determination of the strange vector form factors at $Q^2 = 0.1$ GeV$^2$ (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4, G0) have been interpreted in terms of $uuds\bar{s}$ configurations very different from the kaon-loop configurations usually associated with strangeness in the nucleon. New experiments are being proposed to improve the state of our knowledge of the $\nu p$ elastic cross section -- these new experiments will push the range of $Q^2$ to much lower values, and greatly increase the precision of the $\nu p$ elastic data. One outcome of this can be a measurement of the strangeness contribution to the nucleon spin, $\Delta s$. Nuclear targets (e.g. C or Ar) are to be used in these neutrino experiments, and so a deep understanding of the nuclear physics, particularly in regard to final state effects, is needed before the potential of these precision experiments can be fully realized.

VIMOS-VLT spectroscopy of the giant Ly-alpha nebulae associated with three z~2.5 radio galaxies - The morphological and spectroscopic properties of the giant (>60 kpc) Ly-alpha nebulae associated with three radio galaxies at z~2.5 (MRC 1558-003, MRC 2025-218 and MRC 0140-257) have been investigated using integral field spectroscopic data obtained with VIMOS on VLT. The morphologies are varied. The nebula of one source has a centrally peaked, rounded appearance. In the other two objects, it consists of two spatial components. The three nebulae are aligned with the radio axis within <30 deg. The total Ly-alpha luminosities are in the range (0.3-3.4) x 1e44 erg s-1. The Ly-alpha spectral profile shows strong variation through the nebulae, with FWHM values in the range ~400-1500 km s-1 and velocity shifts V~120-600 km s-1. We present an infall model which can explain successfully most Ly-alpha morphological and spectroscopic properties of the nebula associated with MRC 1558-003. This adds further support to our previous conclusion that the _quiescent_ giant nebulae associated with this and other high redshift powerful radio galaxies are in infall. A problem for this model is the difficulty to reproduce the large Ly-alpha FWHM values. We have discovered a giant (~85 kpc) Ly-alpha nebula associated with the radio galaxy MRC 0140-257 at z=2.64. It shows strikingly relaxed kinematics (FWHM< 300 km s-1 and V<120 km s-1), unique among high z (>2) radio galaxies.

Condensation of Vortex-Strings: Effective Potential Contribution Through Dual Actions - Topological excitations are believed to play an important role in different areas of physics. For example, one case of topical interest is the use of dual models of quantum cromodynamics to understand properties of its vacuum and confinement through the condensation of magnetic monopoles and vortices. Other applications are related to the role of these topological excitations, nonhomogeneous solutions of the field equations, in phase transitions associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories, whose study is of importance in phase transitions in the early universe, for instance. Here we show a derivation of a model dual to the scalar Abelian Higgs model where its topological excitations, namely vortex-strings, become manifest and can be treated in a quantum field theory way. The derivation of the nontrivial contribution of these vacuum excitations to phase transitions and its analogy with superconductivity is then made possible and they are studied here.

Observation of Anti-correlation between Scintillation and Ionization for MeV Gamma-Rays in Liquid Xenon - A strong anti-correlation between ionization and scintillation signals produced by MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon has been measured and used to improve the energy resolution by combining the two signals. The improvement is explained by reduced electron-ion recombination fluctuations of the combined signal compared to fluctuations of the individual signals. Simultaneous measurements of ionization and scintillation signals were carried out with Cs-137, Na-22 and Co-60 gamma rays, as a function of electric field in the liquid. A resolution of 1.7%(sigma) at 662 keV was measured at 1 kV/cm, significantly better than the resolution from either scintillation or ionization alone. A detailed analysis indicates that further improvement to less than 1%(sigma) is possible with higher light collection efficiency and lower electronic noise.

Massive Stars: From the VLT to the ELT - New facilities and technologies have advanced our understanding of massive stars significantly over the past 30 years. Here I introduce a new large survey of massive stars using VLT-FLAMES, noting the target fields and observed binary fractions. These data have been used for the first empirical test of the metallicity dependence of the intensity of stellar winds, finding good agreement with theory -- an important result for the evolutionary models that are used to interpret distant clusters, starbursts, and star-forming galaxies. Looking ahead, plans for future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are now undergoing significant development, and offer the exciting prospect of observing spatially-resolved massive stars well beyond the Local Group.

"Illusion of control" in Minority and Parrondo Games - Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny. This ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of when and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative) strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a precise definition of the "illusion of control" in set-ups a priori defined to emphasize the importance of optimization.

Classification of Noncommuting Quadrilaterals of Factors - A quadrilateral of factors is an irreducible inclusion of factors $N \subset M$ with intermediate subfactors $P$ and $Q$ such that $P$ and $Q$ generate $M$ and the intersection of $P$ and $Q$ is $N$. We investigate the structure of a non-commuting quadrilateral of factors with all the elementary inclusions $P\subset M$, $Q\subset M$, $N\subset P$, and $N\subset Q$ 2-supertransitive. In particular we classify such quadrilaterals with the indices of the elementary subfactors less than or equal to 4. We also compute the angles between $P$ and $Q$ for quadrilaterals coming from $\alpha$-induction and asymptotic inclusions.

Investigation of Energy Spectrum of EGRET Gamma-ray Sources by an Extensive Air Shower Experiment - Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) ($E>100 $TeV) Extensive Air Showers (EASs) have been monitored for a period of five years (1997-2003), using a small array of scintillation detectors in Tehran, Iran. The data have been analyzed to take in to account of the dependence of source counts on zenith angle. Because of varying thickness of the overlaying atmosphere, the shower count rate is extremely dependent on zenith angle. During a calendar year different sources come in the field of view of the array at varying zenith angles and have different effective observation time equivalent to zenith in a day. High energy gamma-ray sources from the EGRET third catalogue where observed and the data were analyzed using an excess method. Upper limits were obtained for 10 EGRET sources. Then we investigated the EAS event rates for these 10 sources and obtained a flux for each of them using parameters of our experiment results and simulations. Finally we investigated the gamma-ray spectrum in the UHE range using these fluxes with reported fluxes of the EGRET sources.

Conjugate field and fluctuation-dissipation relation for the dynamic phase transition in the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model - The two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when exposed to an oscillating applied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium, second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the period-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero, period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent, \delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for the critical isotherm, \delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that, for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use of the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility, \partial<Q> / \partial H_b, in the critical region.

Non-commutativity and Open Strings Dynamics in Melvin Universes - We compute the Moyal phase factor for open strings ending on D3-branes wrapping a NSNS Melvin universe in a decoupling limit explicitly using world sheet formalism in cylindrical coordinates.

High Galactic Latitude Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen Structure and Associated (WMAP) High Frequency Continuum Emission - Spatial associations have been found between interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission morphology and small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in an area bounded by l = 60 & 180 deg, b = 30 & 70 deg, which was the primary target for this study. This area is marked by the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of intermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightest peaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area is examined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated that the associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close examination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of diffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity cloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft X-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is suggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one another, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of enhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possible that dust grains play a role in producing the emission. However, the primary purpose of this report is to draw attention to these apparent associations without offering an unambiguous explanation as to the relevant emission mechanism(s).

Negative- and positive-phase-velocity propagation in an isotropic chiral medium moving at constant velocity - Analysis of electromagnetic planewave propagation in a medium which is a spatiotemporally homogeneous, temporally nonlocal, isotropic, chiral medium in a co-moving frame of reference shows that the medium is both spatially and temporally nonlocal with respect to all non-co-moving inertial frames of reference. Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields, we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames.

Sensitivity of solar off-limb line profiles to electron density stratification and the velocity distribution anisotropy - The effect of the electron density stratification on the intensity profiles of the H I Ly-$\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar coronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification. However, Ly-$\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The calculated total intensities of Ly-$\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed profiles of Ly-$\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as previous investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...

Subfactors and Hadamard Matrices - To any complex Hadamard matrix H one associates a spin model commuting square, and therefore a hyperfinite subfactor. The standard invariant of this subfactor captures certain "group-like" symmetries of H. To gain some insight, we compute the first few relative commutants of such subfactors for Hadamard matrices of small dimensions. Also, we show that subfactors arising from Dita type matrices have intermediate subfactors, and thus their standard invariants have some extra structure besides the Jones projections.

SW Sextantis stars: the dominant population of CVs with orbital periods between 3-4 hours - [Abridged] We present time-series optical photometry of five new CVs identified by the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933, HS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of 3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS 0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2) h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS 0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand, the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.

Finding (or not) New Gamma-ray Pulsars with GLAST - Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources observed by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio pulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray observations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this range, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a pointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be conducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and statistics scale with various parameters.

Did time begin? Will time end? - Did time begin at a Big Bang? Will the present expansion of the universe last for a finite or infinite time? These questions sound philosophical but are becoming, now in the twenty-first century, central to the scientific study of cosmology. The answers, which should become clarified in the next decade or two, could have profound implications for how we see our own role in the universe. Since the original publication of Stephen Hawking's {\it A Brief History of Time} in 1988, the answers to these questions have progressed as a result of research by the community of active theoretical physicists including myself. To present the underlying ideas requires discussion of a wide range of topics in cosmology, especially the make up of the energy content of the universe. A brief summary of my conclusions, that of three different possibilities concerning the history and future of time, the least likely is the conventional wisdom (time began and will never end) and most likely is a cyclic model (time never begins or ends), is in the short final Chapter which could be read first. To understand the reasoning leading to my conclusions could encourage reading of my entire book. My hope in writing this, my first popular book, is that it will engender reflection about time. Many a non-scientist may already hold a philosophical opinion about whether time begins and ends. This book's aim is to present some recently discovered scientific facts which can focus the reader's consideration of the two short questions in my title.

FUSE Observations of the Dwarf Novae UU Aql, BV Cen, and CH UMa in Quiescence - We report on FUSE spectra of three U Gem-type, long period, dwarf novae, UU Aql, BV Cen and CH UMa taken during their quiescence intervals. We discuss the line identifications in their spectra and attempt to characterize the source(s) of their FUV flux distribution. Archival IUE spectrum of CH UMa and BV Cen in quiescence were identified as having a matching flux level with the FUSE spectra and these were combined with each FUSE spectrum to broaden the wavelength coverage and further constrain model fits. Multi-component synthetic spectral fits from our model grids, consisting of single temperature white dwarfs, two-temperature white dwarfs, accretion disks and white dwarfs plus accretion disks, were applied to the FUSE spectra alone and to the combined FUSE + IUE spectra. We present the results of our model analyses and their implications.

Experimental and theoretical study of light scattering by individual mature red blood cells by use of scanning flow cytometry and discrete dipole approximation - Elastic light scattering by mature red blood cells (RBCs) was theoretically and experimentally analyzed with the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and the scanning flow cytometry (SFC), respectively. SFC permits measurement of angular dependence of light-scattering intensity (indicatrix) of single particles. A mature RBC is modeled as a biconcave disk in DDA simulations of light scattering. We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to the direction of the incident light upon the indicatrix. Numerical calculations of indicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried out. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC showed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We simulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for RBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk, the disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two orientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence. Only the oblate spheroid model for rim-on incidence gives results similar to the rigorous biconcave disk model.

Inflation, bifurcations of nonlinear curvature Lagrangians and dark energy - A possible equivalence of scalar dark matter, the inflaton, and modified gravity is analyzed. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective Lagrangian on the curvature is not only singular but also bifurcates into several almost Einsteinian spaces, distinguished only by a different effective gravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail catastrophe in the bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different Einsteinian domains in our Universe. This `triple unification' may shed new light on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but also on `dark energy', regarded as an effective cosmological constant, and inflation.

Stability of Chaplygin gas thin-shell wormholes - In this paper we construct spherical thin-shell wormholes supported by a Chaplygin gas. For a rather general class of geometries we introduce a new approach for the stability analysis of static solutions under perturbations preserving the symmetry. We apply this to wormholes constructed from Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-de Sitter, Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics. In the last two cases, we find that there are values of the parameters for which stable static solutions exist.

Lattice refining loop quantum cosmology, anisotropic models and stability - A general class of loop quantizations for anisotropic models is introduced and discussed, which enhances loop quantum cosmology by relevant features seen in inhomogeneous situations. The main new effect is an underlying lattice which is being refined during dynamical changes of the volume. In general, this leads to a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant step-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models can be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior. Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong constraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental Hamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large class of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this context, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of metric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently in more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were artificially suppressed.

Testing Disk Instability Models for Giant Planet Formation - Disk instability is an attractive yet controversial means for the rapid formation of giant planets in our solar system and elsewhere. Recent concerns regarding the first adiabatic exponent of molecular hydrogen gas are addressed and shown not to lead to spurious clump formation in the author's disk instability models. A number of disk instability models have been calculated in order to further test the robustness of the mechanism, exploring the effects of changing the pressure equation of state, the vertical temperature profile, and other parameters affecting the temperature distribution. Possible reasons for differences in results obtained by other workers are discussed. Disk instability remains as a plausible formation mechanism for giant planets.

High-dimensional variable selection - This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two stages as "screening" and the last stage as "cleaning." We consider three screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain conditions.

Depletion effects in smectic phases of hard rod--hard sphere mixtures - It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter, which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes (spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\tau$ parameter exhibits a linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\tau\sim d^3$.

In Search of the Spacetime Torsion - Whether torsion plays or not a role in the description of the gravitational interaction is a problem that can only be solved by experiment. This is, however, a difficult task: since there are different possible interpretations for torsion, there is no a model-independent way to look for it. In these notes, two different possibilities will be reviewed, their consistency analyzed, and the corresponding experimental outputs briefly discussed.

Observations of chemical differentiation in clumpy molecular clouds - We have extensively mapped a sample of dense molecular clouds (L1512, TMC-1C, L1262, Per 7, L1389, L1251E) in lines of HC3N, CH3OH, SO and C^{18}O. We demonstrate that a high degree of chemical differentiation is present in all of the observed clouds. We analyse the molecular maps for each cloud, demonstrating a systematic chemical differentiation across the sample, which we relate to the evolutionary state of the cloud. We relate our observations to the cloud physical, kinematical and evolutionary properties, and also compare them to the predictions of simple chemical models. The implications of this work for understanding the origin of the clumpy structures and chemical differentiation observed in dense clouds are discussed.

Challenges for MSSM Higgs searches at Hadron Colliders - In this article we analyze the impact of B-physics and Higgs physics at LEP on standard and non-standard Higgs bosons searches at the Tevatron and the LHC, within the framework of minimal flavor violating supersymmetric models. The B-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of the rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on the B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe for large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the non-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the Higgsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of non-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available ATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search channels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter space. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider sensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it may be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small or moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.

Optimization in Gradient Networks - Gradient networks can be used to model the dominant structure of complex networks. Previous works have focused on random gradient networks. Here we study gradient networks that minimize jamming on substrate networks with scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structure. We introduce structural correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other dynamical processes in real network systems.

Fermionic construction of partition function for multi-matrix models and multi-component TL hierarchy - We use $p$-component fermions $(p=2,3,...)$ to present $(2p-2)N$-fold integrals as a fermionic expectation value. This yields fermionic representation for various $(2p-2)$-matrix models. Links with the $p$-component KP hierarchy and also with the $p$-component TL hierarchy are discussed. We show that the set of all (but two) flows of $p$-component TL changes standard matrix models to new ones.

The Plasma Puddle as a Perturbative Black Hole - We argue that the weak coupling regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs phase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space. They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black (i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we conjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.

Information, complexity, brains and reality (Kolmogorov Manifesto) - I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic) Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.

Aspects of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems: The nonequilibrium-potential approach - We analyze several aspects of the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems, exploiting the nonequilibrium potential's framework. The generalization of this formalism (sketched in the appendix) to extended systems is first carried out in the context of a simplified scalar model, for which stationary patterns can be found analytically. We first show how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by the range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we find an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.

Distortion of Gravitational-Wave Packets Due to their Self-Gravity - When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time, the leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of the pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the self-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a radius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave distortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in numerical simulations.

Fermionic approach to the evaluation of integrals of rational symmetric functions - We use the fermionic construction of two-matrix model partition functions to evaluate integrals over rational symmetric functions. This approach is complementary to the one used in the paper ``Integrals of Rational Symmetric Functions, Two-Matrix Models and Biorthogonal Polynomials'' \cite{paper2}, where these integrals were evaluated by a direct method.

Old Main-Sequence Turnoff Photometry in the Small Magellanic Cloud. I. Constraints on the Star Formation History in Different Fields - We present ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), reaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs with good photometric accuracy for twelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between ~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different parts of the SMC such as the "Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack of a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate that a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed fields.

Curvature perturbations from ekpyrotic collapse with multiple fields - A scale-invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have steep negative exponential potentials. The scale invariance of the spectrum is realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the Hubble scale at the transition.

Asymmetric Di-jet Production in Polarized Hadronic Collisions - Using the collinear QCD factorization approach, we study the single-transverse-spin dependent cross section Delta sigma(S_perp) for the hadronic production of two jets of momenta P_1=P+q/2 and P_2=-P+q/2. We consider the kinematic region where the transverse components of the momentum vectors satisfy P_perp >> q_perp >> Lambda_QCD. For the case of initial-state gluon radiation, we show that at the leading power in q_perp/P_perp and at the lowest non-trivial perturbative order, the dependence of Delta sigma(S_perp) on q_perp decouples from that on P_perp, so that the cross section can be factorized into a hard part that is a function only of the single scale P_perp, and into perturbatively generated transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions with transverse momenta k_perp = O(q_perp).

Information, information processing and gravity - I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processing by gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing require energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black hole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically, I use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Once the hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly: the existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the Planck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound on the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section I discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information in the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe are determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes. This paper is based on a talk presented at a 2007 Bellairs Research Institute (McGill University) workshop on black holes and quantum information.

Noise-induced phase transitions: Effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum - The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely noise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a \emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for (q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the ``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises' statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting effect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.

The Mid-Infrared Emission of M87 - We discuss Subaru and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy of M87 in the mid-infrared from 5-35 um. These observations allow us to investigate mid-IR emission mechanisms in the core of M87 and to establish that the flaring, variable jet component HST-1 is not a major contributor to the mid-IR flux. The Spitzer data include a high signal-to-noise 15-35 $\mu$m spectrum of the knot A/B complex in the jet, which is consistent with synchrotron emission. However, a synchrotron model cannot account for the observed {\it nuclear} spectrum, even when contributions from the jet, necessary due to the degrading of resolution with wavelength, are included. The Spitzer data show a clear excess in the spectrum of the nucleus at wavelengths longer than 25 um, which we model as thermal emission from cool dust at a characteristic temperature of 55 \pm 10 K, with an IR luminosity \sim 10^{39} {\rm ~erg ~s^{-1}}. Given Spitzer's few-arcsecond angular resolution, the dust seen in the nuclear spectrum could be located anywhere within ~5'' (390 pc) of the nucleus. In any case, the ratio of AGN thermal to bolometric luminosity indicates that M87 does not contain the IR-bright torus that classical unified AGN schemes invoke. However, this result is consistent with theoretical predictions for low-luminosity AGNs

Fermionic construction of tau functions and random processes - Tau functions expressed as fermionic expectation values are shown to provide a natural and straightforward description of a number of random processes and statistical models involving hard core configurations of identical particles on the integer lattice, like a discrete version simple exclusion processes (ASEP), nonintersecting random walkers, lattice Coulomb gas models and others, as well as providing a powerful tool for combinatorial calculations involving paths between pairs of partitions. We study the decay of the initial step function within the discrete ASEP (d-ASEP) model as an example.

Novelty and Collective Attention - The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.

Characterization of open cluster remnants - Despite progress in the theoretical knowledge of open cluster remnants and the growing search for observational identifications in recent years, open questions still remain. The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants and criteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this work we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii) to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved binary star distributions of open clusters.

Hall conductivity from dyonic black holes - A class of strongly interacting 2+1 dimensional conformal field theories in a transverse magnetic field can be studied using the AdS/CFT duality. We compute zero momentum hydrodynamic response functions of maximally supersymmetric 2+1 dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at the conformal fixed point, in the large N limit. With background magnetic field B and electric charge density rho, the Hall conductivity is found to be rho/B. The result, anticipated on kinematic grounds in field theory, is obtained from perturbations of a four dimensional AdS black hole with both electric and magnetic charges.

The Fincher-Burke spin excitations and omega/T scaling in the insulating 5% Sr-doped La2CuO4 - Insulating La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 shares with superconducting cuprates the same Fincher-Burke-like spin excitations, which usually are observed in itinerant antiferromagnets. The local spectral function satisfies omega/T scaling above ~16 K for this incommensurate insulating cuprate. Together with previous results in commensurate insulating and incommensurate superconducting cuprates, these results further support the general scaling prediction for square-lattice quantum spin S=1/2 systems. The width of incommensurate peaks in La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 scales to a similar finite value as at optimal doping, strongly suggesting that they are similarly distant from a quantum critical point. They might both be limited to a finite correlation length by the partial spin-glass freezing.

Binary Capture Rates for Massive Protostars - The high multiplicity of massive stars in dense, young clusters is established early in their evolution. The mechanism behind this remains unresolved. Recent results suggest that massive protostars may capture companions through disk interactions with much higher efficiency than their solar mass counterparts. However, this conclusion is based on analytic determinations of capture rates and estimates of the robustness of the resulting binaries. We present the results of coupled n-body and SPH simulations of star-disk encounters to further test the idea that disk-captured binaries contribute to the observed multiplicity of massive stars.

Sharp Asymptotics for KPP Pulsating Front Speed-up and Diffusion Enhancement by Flows - We study KPP pulsating front speed-up and effective diffusivity enhancement by general periodic incompressible flows. We prove the existence of and determine the limits $c^*(A)/A$ and $D(A)/A^2$ as $A\to\infty$, where $c^*(A)$ is the minimal front speed and $D(A)$ the effective diffusivity.

Pulsating Front Speed-up and Quenching of Reaction by Fast Advection - We consider reaction-diffusion equations with combustion-type non-linearities in two dimensions and study speed-up of their pulsating fronts by general periodic incompressible flows with a cellular structure. We show that the occurence of front speed-up in the sense $\lim_{A\to\infty} c_*(A)=\infty$, with $A$ the amplitude of the flow and $c_*(A)$ the (minimal) front speed, only depends on the geometry of the flow and not on the reaction function. In particular, front speed-up happens for KPP reactions if and only if it does for ignition reactions. We also show that the flows which achieve this speed-up are precisely those which, when scaled properly, are able to quench any ignition reaction.

Electroweak Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance - We point out that it is possible to associate the electroweak Higgs boson with the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, thus resolving the hierarchy problem in a technically natural way. We illustrate this idea with two specific gauge models. Besides being consistent with all currently available experimental data, both models maintain the predictive power of the standard model, since the first model has only one additional parameter beyond the standard model, and the second has the same number of free parameters as the standard model.

A linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model of self-synchronizing oscillators - The present paper introduces a linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model describing a self-synchronizing phase transition in a system of globally coupled oscillators that in general have different characteristic frequencies. The reformulated model provides an alternative coherent framework through which one can analytically tackle synchronization problems that are not amenable to the original Kuramoto analysis. It allows one to solve explicitly for the synchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full phase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators (unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the mean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it possible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state. While discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling, the new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to solving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.

Electron Transport in Nanogranular Ferromagnets - We study electronic transport properties of ferromagnetic nanoparticle arrays and nanodomain materials near the Curie temperature in the limit of weak coupling between the grains. We calculate the conductivity in the Ohmic and non-Ohmic regimes and estimate the magnetoresistance jump in the resistivity at the transition temperature. The results are applicable for many emerging materials, including artificially self-assembled nanoparticle arrays and a certain class of manganites, where localization effects within the clusters can be neglected.

Electronic Properties of Carbon Nanotubes Calculated from Density Functional Theory and the Empirical pi-Bond Model - The validity of the DFT models implemented by FIREBALL for CNT electronic device modeling is assessed. The effective masses, band gaps, and transmission coefficients of semi-conducting, zigzag, (n,0) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) resulting from the ab initio tight-binding density functional theory (DFT) code FIREBALL and the empirical, nearest-neighbor pi-bond model are compared for all semiconducting n values 5 <(=) n <(=) 35. The DFT values for the effective masses differ from the pi-bond values by +(-) 9% over the range of n values, 17 <(=) n <(=) 29, most important for electronic device applications. Over the range 13 <(=) n <(=) 35, the DFT bandgaps are less than the empirical bandgaps by 20-180 meV depending on the functional and the n value. The pi-bond model gives results that differ signifcantly from the DFT results when the CNT diameter goes below 1 nm due to the large curvature of the CNT. The pi-bond model quickly becomes inaccurate away from the bandedges for a (10, 0) CNT, and it is completely inaccurate for n <(=) 8.

Holographic bound and protein linguistics - The holographic bound in physics constrains the complexity of life. The finite storage capability of information in the observable universe requires the protein linguistics in the evolution of life. We find that the evolution of genetic code determines the variance of amino acid frequencies and genomic GC content among species. The elegant linguistic mechanism is confirmed by the experimental observations based on all known entire proteomes.

Externally-polluted white dwarfs with dust disks - We report Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of eleven externally-polluted white dwarfs. Of the nine stars for which we have IRAC photometry, we find that GD 40, GD 133 and PG 1015+161 each has an infrared excess that can be understood as arising from a flat, opaque, dusty disk. GD 56 also has an infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar dust, but a flat-disk model cannot reproduce the data unless there are grains as warm as 1700 K and perhaps not even then. Our data support the previous suggestion that the metals in the atmosphere of GD 40 are the result of accretion of a tidally-disrupted asteroid with a chondritic composition.

Highly synchronized noise-driven oscillatory behavior of a FitzHugh-Nagumo ring with phase-repulsive coupling - We investigate a ring of $N$ FitzHugh--Nagumo elements coupled in \emph{phase-repulsive} fashion and submitted to a (subthreshold) common oscillatory signal and independent Gaussian white noises. This system can be regarded as a reduced version of the one studied in [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{64}, 041912 (2001)], although externally forced and submitted to noise. The noise-sustained synchronization of the system with the external signal is characterized.

Disentanglement in a quantum critical environment - We study the dynamical process of disentanglement of two qubits and two qutrits coupled to an Ising spin chain in a transverse field, which exhibits a quantum phase transition. We use the concurrence and negativity to quantify entanglement of two qubits and two qutrits, respectively. Explicit connections between the concurrence (negativity) and the decoherence factors are given for two initial states, the pure maximally entangled state and the mixed Werner state. We find that the concurrence and negativity decay exponentially with fourth power of time in the vicinity of critical point of the environmental system.

The Deviation of the Vacuum Refractive Index Induced by a Static Gravitational Field - We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the observational result of the light deflection in solar gravitational field as well as the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived an analytical expression of the refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the deviation of the vacuum refractive index is composed of two parts: one is caused by the time dilation effect, the other is caused by the length contraction effect. As an application, we simulated the effect of the gravitational lensing through computer programming and found that the missing central imaging could be interpreted in a reasonable way.

Deaconstructing Functions on Quadratic Surfaces into Multipoles - Any homogeneous polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ of degree $d$, being restricted to a unit sphere $S^2$, admits essentially a unique representation of the form $\lambda + \sum_{k = 1}^d [\prod_{j = 1}^k L_{kj}]$, where $L_{kj}$'s are linear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\lambda$ is a real number. The coefficients of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \emph{multipole} vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations of polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$, real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator $\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\Delta_Q$ that are constructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce modular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipole spaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments to the ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\pi, 1)$-spaces, where $\pi$ runs over a variety of modified braid groups.

Complete synchronization of convective patterns between Gray-Scott systems - Two identical 1D autocatalytic systems with Gray--Scott kinetics--driven towards convectively unstable regimes and submitted to independent spatiotemporal Gaussian white noises--are coupled unidirectionally, but otherwise linearly. Numerical simulation then reveals that (even when perturbed by noise) the slave system replicates the convective patterns arising in the master one to a very high degree of precision, as indicated by several measures of synchronization.

Hydrodynamical model atmospheres and 3D spectral synthesis - We discuss three issues in the context of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical model atmospheres for late-type stars, related to spectral line shifts, radiative transfer in metal-poor 3D models, and the solar oxygen abundance. We include a brief overview about the model construction, taking the radiation-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD (COnservative COde for the COmputation of COmpressible COnvection in a BOx of L Dimensions with L=2,3) and the related spectral synthesis package Linfor3D as examples.

Temperature effects on quantum cloning of states and entanglement - Performances of the symmetric universal and phase-covariant cloning transformations and entanglement cloners -- qubit case -- are investigated when the initial state of the hardware or the original state to be cloned is weakly coupled to a thermal environment. Different behaviors of each of these transformations are analyzed and contrasted with the ideal cases.

Large Gauge Hierarchy in Gauge-Higgs Unification - We study a five dimensional nonsupersymmetric SU(3) gauge theory compactified on $M^4\times S^1/Z_2$. The gauge hierarchy is discussed in the scenario of the gauge-Higgs unification. We present two models in which the large gauge hierarchy is realized, that is, the weak scale is naturally is obtained from an unique large scale such as a GUT and the Planck scale. We also study the Higgs mass in each model.

Self-organized metal nanostructures through laser driven thermocapillary convection - When ultrathin metal films are subjected to multiple cycles of rapid melting and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser, spatially correlated interfacial nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film self-organizing processes. Here we investigate self-organization and the ensuing length scales when Co films (1-8 nm thick) on SiO_{\text{2}} surfaces are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non-uniform (interference) laser irradiation. Pattern evolution produces nanowires, which eventually break-up into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing, \lambda_{NN2}.The scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by thermocapillary flow and a Rayleigh-like instability. For h_{0}\leq2 nm, a hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation of nanoparticles.

Full Additivity of the Entanglement of Formation - We present a general strategy that allows a more flexible method for the construction of fully additive multipartite entanglement monotones than the ones so far reported in the literature of axiomatic entanglement measures. Within this framework we give a proof of a conjecture of outstanding implications in information theory: the full additivity of the Entanglement of Formation.

Simulation of four-body interaction in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor - Four-body interaction plays an important role in many-body systems, and it can exhibit interesting phase transition behaviors. Historically it was the need to efficiently simulate quantum systems that lead the idea of a quantum computer. In this Letter, we report the experimental demonstration of a four-body interaction in a four- qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor. The strongly modulating pulse is used to implement spin selective excitation. The results show a good agreement between theory and experiment.

An Optical Source Catalog of the North Ecliptic Pole Region - We present a five (u*,g',r',i',z') band optical photometry catalog of the sources in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) region based on deep observations made with MegaCam at CFHT. The source catalog covers about 2 square degree area centered at the NEP and reaches depths of about 26 mag for u*, g', r' bands, about 25 mag for i' band, and about 24 mag for z' band (4 sigma detection over an 1 arcsec aperture). The total number of cataloged sources brighter than r'= 23 mag is about 56,000 including both point sources and extended sources. From the investigation of photometric properties using the color-magnitude diagrams and color-color diagrams, we have found that the colors of extended sources are mostly (u*-r') < 3.0 and (g'-z') > 0.5. This can be used to separate the extended sources from the point sources reliably, even for the faint source domain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly work efficiently. We have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the red sequence galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. By applying this relation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities, we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group.

Confirmation of Cylindrical Perfect Invisibility Cloak Using Fourier-Bessel Analysis - A cylindrical wave expansion method is developed to obtain the scattering field for an ideal two-dimensional cylindrical invisibility cloak. A near-ideal model of the invisibility cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the inner boundary of the cloak shell. We confirm that a cloak with the ideal material parameters is a perfect invisibility cloak by systematically studying the change of the scattering coefficients from the near-ideal case to the ideal one. However, due to the slow convergence of the zero$^{th}$ order scattering coefficients, a tiny perturbation on the cloak would induce a noticeable field scattering and penetration.

Sufficiency Criterion for the Validity of the Adiabatic Approximation - We examine the quantitative condition which has been widely used as a criterion for the adiabatic approximation but was recently found insufficient. Our results indicate that the usual quantitative condition is sufficient for a special class of quantum mechanical systems. For general systems, it may not be sufficient, but it along with additional conditions is sufficient. The usual quantitative condition and the additional conditions constitute a general criterion for the validity of the adiabatic approximation, which is applicable to all $N-$dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we illustrate the use of the general quantitative criterion in some physical models.

Five-dimensional N = 1 AdS superspace: Geometry, off-shell multiplets and dynamics - As a step towards formulating projective superspace techniques for supergravity theories with eight supercharges, this work is devoted to field theory in five-dimensional N = 1 anti-de Sitter superspace AdS^{5|8} = SU(2,2|1)/SO(4,1) x U(1) which is a maximally symmetric curved background. We develop the differential geometry of AdS^{5|8} and describe its isometries in terms of Killing supervectors. Various off-shell supermultiplets in AdS^{5|8} x S^2 are defined, and supersymmetric actions are constructed both in harmonic and projective superspace approaches. Several families of supersymmetric theories are presented including nonlinear sigma-models, Chern-Simons theories and vector-tensor dynamical systems. Using a suitable coset representative, we make use of the coset construction to develop an explicit realization for one half of the superspace AdS^{5|8} as a trivial fiber bundle with fibers isomorophic to four-dimensional Minkowski superspace.

Domain wall entropy of the bimodal two-dimensional Ising spin glass - We report calculations of the domain wall entropy for the bimodal two-dimensional Ising spin glass in the critical ground state. The L * L system sizes are large with L up to 256. We find that it is possible to fit the variance of the domain wall entropy to a power function of L. However, the quality of the data distributions are unsatisfactory with large L > 96. Consequently, it is not possible to reliably determine the fractal dimension of the domain walls.

Magnetic structure of CeRhIn$_{5}$ under magnetic field - The magnetically ordered ground state of CeRhIn$_{5}$ at ambient pressure and zero magnetic field is an incomensurate helicoidal phase with the propagation vector $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 0.298) and the magnetic moment in the basal plane of the tetragonal structure. We determined by neutron diffraction the two different magnetically ordered phases of CeRhIn$_{5}$ evidenced by bulk measurements under applied magnetic field in its basal plane. The low temperature high magnetic phase corresponds to a sine-wave structure of the magnetization being commensurate with $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 1/4). At high temperature, the phase is incommensurate with $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 0.298) and a possible small ellipticity. The propagation vector of this phase is the same as the one of the zero-field structure.

Fermionic Collective Modes in QGP near Critical Temperatures - We investigate the quark spectrum in the quark-gluon plasma phase near color superconducting (CS) and chiral phase transitions. Owing to the precursory soft modes of the phase transitions, there appear novel excitaion spectra: In the CS transition, the quark matter shows non-Fermi liquid behavior and leads to the pseudogap in the density of states of quarks. In the chiral transition, three collective excitations appear in the quark spectrum.

The Kinematics and Dynamics of the Globular Clusters and the Planetary Nebulae of NGC 5128 - A new kinematic and dynamic study of the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy, NGC 5128, is presented. From a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340 globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotation axis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for the halo of NGC 5128. The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radial dependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular cluster sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0) globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass estimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12) Msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and (1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius of 50 kpc. Lastly, we present a new and homogeneous catalog of known globular clusters in NGC 5128. This catalog combines all previous definitive cluster identifications from radial velocity studies and HST imaging studies, as well as 80 new globular clusters from a study of M.A. Beasley et al. (2007, in preparation).

Topological Properties of Phase Singularities in Wave Fields - Phase singularities as topological objects of wave fields appear in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological scenarios. In this paper, by making use of the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, we study the topological properties of the phase singularities in two and three dimensional space in details. The topological inner structure of the phase singularities are obtained, and the topological charge of the phase singularities are expressed by the topological numbers: Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees. Furthermore, the topological invariant of the closed and knotted phase singularities in three dimensional space are also discussed in details.

Five Intermediate-Period Planets from the N2K Sample - We report the detection of five Jovian mass planets orbiting high metallicity stars. Four of these stars were first observed as part of the N2K program and exhibited low RMS velocity scatter after three consecutive observations. However, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal the presence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days to a few years. HD 11506 is a G0V star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a 3.85 year orbit. HD 17156 is a G0V star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 day orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a planet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet places it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been detected. HD 125612 is a G3V star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4 year orbit. HD 170469 is a G5IV star with a planet of \msini = 0.67 \mjup in a 3.13 year orbit. HD 231701 is an F8V star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142 day orbit. All of these stars have supersolar metallicity. Three of the five stars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightness variability. A transit search conducted for HD 17156 was negative but covered only 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

Arithmetic homology and an integral version of Katos conjecture - We define an integral Borel-Moore homology theory over finite fields, called arithmetic homology, and an integral version of Kato homology. Both types of groups are expected to be finitely generated, and sit in a long exact sequence with higher Chow groups of zero-cycles.

Production of Anticentauro Events in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions - We propose a novel method for studying the production of anticentauro events in high energy heavy ion collisions utilizing Chebyshev expansion coefficients. These coefficients have proved to be very efficient in investigating the pattern of fluctuations in neutral pion fraction. For the anticentauro like events, the magnitude of first few coefficients is strongly enhanced (~3 times) as compared to those of normal HIJING events. Various characteristics of Chebyshev coefficients are studied in detail and the probability of formation of exotic events is calculated from the simulated events.

Finite-size scaling of pseudo-critical point distributions in the random transverse-field Ising chain - We study the distribution of finite size pseudo-critical points in a one-dimensional random quantum magnet with a quantum phase transition described by an infinite randomness fixed point. Pseudo-critical points are defined in three different ways: the position of the maximum of the average entanglement entropy, the scaling behavior of the surface magnetization, and the energy of a soft mode. All three lead to a log-normal distribution of the pseudo-critical transverse fields, where the width scales as $L^{-1/\nu}$ with $\nu=2$ and the shift of the average value scales as $L^{-1/\nu_{typ}}$ with $\nu_{typ}=1$, which we related to the scaling of average and typical quantities in the critical region.

On the Kaehler rank of compact complex surfaces - Harvey and Lawson introduced the Kaehler rank and computed it in connection to the cone of positive exact currents of bidimension (1,1) for many classes of compact complex surfaces. In this paper we extend these computations to the only further known class of surfaces not considered by them, that of Kato surfaces. Our main tool is the reduction to the dynamics of associated holomorphic contractions.

Novel algorithm to calculate hypervolume indicator of Pareto approximation set - Hypervolume indicator is a commonly accepted quality measure for comparing Pareto approximation set generated by multi-objective optimizers. The best known algorithm to calculate it for $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space has a run time of $O(n^{d/2})$ with special data structures. This paper presents a recursive, vertex-splitting algorithm for calculating the hypervolume indicator of a set of $n$ non-comparable points in $d>2$ dimensions. It splits out multiple child hyper-cuboids which can not be dominated by a splitting reference point. In special, the splitting reference point is carefully chosen to minimize the number of points in the child hyper-cuboids. The complexity analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves $O((\frac{d}{2})^n)$ time and $O(dn^2)$ space complexity in the worst case.

Statistical properties of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar - We have studied the statistics of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar for the first time with particular reference to their widths. We have analyzed data collected during 3.5 hours of observations conducted with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope operated in a tied-array mode at a frequency of 1200 MHz. The PuMa pulsar backend provided voltage recording of X and Y linear polarization states in two conjugate 10 MHz bands. We restricted the time resolution to 4 microseconds to match the scattering on the interstellar inhomogeneities. In total about 18000 giant pulses (GP) were detected in full intensity with a threshold level of 6 sigma. Cumulative probability distributions (CPD) of giant pulse energies were analyzed for groups of GPs with different effective widths in the range 4 to 65 microseconds. The CPDs were found to manifest notable differences for the different GP width groups. The slope of a power-law fit to the high-energy portion of the CPDs evolves from -1.7 to -3.2 when going from the shortest to the longest GPs. There are breaks in the CPD power-law fits indicating flattening at low energies with indices varying from -1.0 to -1.9 for the short and long GPs respectively. The GPs with a stronger peak flux density were found to be of shorter duration. We compare our results with previously published data and discuss the importance of these peculiarities in the statistical properties of GPs for the heoretical understanding of the emission mechanism responsible for GP generation.

A Doubly Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Network Coding - We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways: along genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate solutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring significant penalties.

Study of resonant processes for multi-pion production in $\bar p +p\to\ell ^++\ell^- +n_\pi \pi$ annihilation - In frame of a phenomenological approach based on Compton-like Feynman amplitudes, we study multi-pion production in antiproton nucleon collisions. The main interest of this reaction is related to the possibility to study the properties of the presumable $\bar N N$ atom and of its resonances. For the case of formation of a scalar or pseudoscalar resonant state, with $I^G(J^{P})=1^-(0^{\pm}),~0^+(0^-)$ numerical results are obtained. The differential cross section in an experimental set-up where the pions invariant mass is measured, is given with explicit dependence on the lepton pair and pions invariant mass.

Low frequency dispersive estimates for the Schrodinger group in higher dimensions - We prove dispersive estimates for the low frequency part of the Schrodinger group for a large class of potentials in dimensions greater or equal to four. As a consequence, we extend the result of Journe, Sofer and Sogge to a larger class of potentials. In this revised version a mistake in the proof of the estimate (B.4) is removed.

Evaluation of the Axial Vector Commutator Sum Rule for Pion-Pion Scattering - We consider the sum rule proposed by one of us (SLA), obtained by taking the expectation value of an axial vector commutator in a state with one pion. The sum rule relates the pion decay constant to integrals of pion-pion cross sections, with one pion off the mass shell. We remark that recent data on pion-pion scattering allow a precise evaluation of the sum rule. We also discuss the related Adler--Weisberger sum rule (obtained by taking the expectation value of the same commutator in a state with one nucleon), especially in connection with the problem of extrapolation of the pion momentum off its mass shell. We find, with current data, that both the pion-pion and pion-nucleon sum rules are satisfied to better than six percent, and we give detailed estimates of the experimental and extrapolation errors in the closure discrepancies.

Colour pairs for constraining the age and metallicity of stellar populations - Using a widely used stellar population synthesis model, we study the ability of using pairs of AB system colours to break the well-known stellar age--metallicity degeneracy and give constraints on the two stellar-population parameters (age and metallicity). The relative age and metallicity sensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J, H, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty parameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89 Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties in colours. Some other colour pairs, such as [(R-K), (u-R)], [(I-K), (u-R)], [(R-K), (u-r)] and [(i-J), (u-R)], can possibly be used for constraining the two parameters, too. As a whole, our results suggest that colours relating to both UBVRIJHK and ugriz magnitudes are much better than either UBVRIJHK colours or ugriz colours for breaking the well-known degeneracy. The results also show that the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) can be estimated via photometry data. It is also shown that the colours can be used in conjunction with line indices to measure stellar-population parameters.

On the Fine Structure of QCD Confining String - This paper had been withdrawn because the prime reported effect had not been confirmed in further investigations (see arXiv:0812.4488 [hep-lat]).

The effect of supernova asymmetry on coalescence rates of binary neutron stars - We study the effect of the kick velocity -- neutron star spin alignment observed in young radio pulsars on the coalescence rate of binary neutron stars. The effect is shown to be especially strong for large kick amplitudes and tight alignments, reducing the galactic rate of binary neutron star coalescences up to an order of magnitude with respect to the rates calculated for random kicks. The spin-kick correlation also leads to much narrower NS spin-orbit misalignments compared to random kicks.

Electronic structure of the zigzag spin-chain compound In$_2$VO$_5$ - Band structure calculations within the local spin-density approximation are presented in order to investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of the zigzag spin-chain compound In$_2$VO$_5$. The essential structural feature of the system is a double chain of VO$_6$-octahedra, which leads to competing intrachain and interchain magnetic couplings. Frustration of the spin-chains is expected for the proposed antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures. However, the band calculations show that the experimental room temperature crystal structure is incompatible with antiferromagnetism. Both the intrachain and interchain coupling is found to be ferromagnetic.

Elasticity with Arbitrarily Shaped Inhomogeneity - A classical problem in elasticity theory involves an inhomogeneity embedded in a material of given stress and shear moduli. The inhomogeneity is a region of arbitrary shape whose stress and shear moduli differ from those of the surrounding medium. In this paper we present a new, semi-analytic method for finding the stress tensor for an infinite plate with such an inhomogeneity. The solution involves two conformal maps, one from the inside and the second from the outside of the unit circle to the inside, and respectively outside, of the inhomogeneity. The method provides a solution by matching the conformal maps on the boundary between the inhomogeneity and the surrounding material. This matching converges well only for relatively mild distortions of the unit circle due to reasons which will be discussed in the article. We provide a comparison of the present result to known previous results.

Asymptotic profiles of solutions to viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations - The large time behavior of solutions to Cauchy problem for viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation is classified. The large time asymptotics are given by very singular self-similar solutions on one hand and by self-similar viscosity solutions on the other hand

Asymptotic profiles of solutions to convection-diffusion equations - The large time behavior of zero mass solutions to the Cauchy problem for a convection-diffusion equation. We provide conditions on the size and shape of the initial datum such that the large time asymptotics of solutions is given either by the derivative of the Guass-Weierstrass kernel or by a self-similar solution or by a hyperbolic N-wave

Characterization of fragment emission in ^{20}Ne (7 - 10 MeV/nucleon) + ^{12}C reactions - The inclusive energy distributions of the complex fragments (3 $\leq$ Z $\leq$ 7) emitted from the bombardment of ^{12}C by ^{20}Ne beams with incident energies between 145 and 200 MeV have been measured in the angular range 10$^{o} \leq \theta_{lab} \leq$ 50^{o}. Damped fragment yields in all the cases have been found to be the characteristic of emission from fully energy equilibrated composites. The binary fragment yields are compared with the standard statistical model predictions. Enhanced yields of entrance channel fragments (5 $\leq$ Z $\leq$ 7) indicate the survival of orbiting-like process in ^{20}Ne + ^{12}C system at these energies.

The dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn in the gaseous proto-planetary disk - We study the possibility that the mutual interactions between Jupiter and Saturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to the Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height, this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in Tsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al. (2005) to explain the current orbital architecture of the giant planets and the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment of the Moon.

Kinetic Theory for Binary Granular Mixtures at Low-Density - Many features of granular media can be modelled as a fluid of hard spheres with {\em inelastic} collisions. Under rapid flow conditions, the macroscopic behavior of grains can be described through hydrodynamic equations. At low-density, a fundamental basis for the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations and explicit expressions for the transport coefficients appearing in them is provided by the Boltzmann kinetic theory conveniently modified to account for inelastic binary collisions. The goal of this chapter is to give an overview of the recent advances made for binary granular gases by using kinetic theory tools. Some of the results presented here cover aspects such as transport properties, energy nonequipartition, instabilities, segregation or mixing, non-Newtonian behavior, .... In addition, comparison of the analytical results with those obtained from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations is also carried out, showing the reliability of kinetic theory to describe granular flows even for strong dissipation.

Optical carrier wave shocking: detection and dispersion - Carrier wave shocking is studied using the Pseudo-Spectral Spatial Domain (PSSD) technique. We describe the shock detection diagnostics necessary for this numerical study, and verify them against theoretical shocking predictions for the dispersionless case. These predictions show Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP) and pulse bandwidth sensitivity in the single-cycle regime. The flexible dispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the linear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to analyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results exhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the limits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms. Combining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or at least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.

Spin-polarized transport through weakly coupled double quantum dots in the Coulomb-blockade regime - We analyze cotunneling transport through two quantum dots in series weakly coupled to external ferromagnetic leads. In the Coulomb blockade regime the electric current flows due to third-order tunneling, while the second-order single-barrier processes have indirect impact on the current by changing the occupation probabilities of the double dot system. We predict a zero-bias maximum in the differential conductance, whose magnitude is conditioned by the value of the inter-dot Coulomb interaction. This maximum is present in both magnetic configurations of the system and results from asymmetry in cotunneling through different virtual states. Furthermore, we show that tunnel magnetoresistance exhibits a distinctively different behavior depending on temperature, being rather independent of the value of inter-dot correlation. Moreover, we find negative TMR in some range of the bias voltage.

Possible origin of Larson's lows - It was found that approximately constant column densities of giant molecular clouds (Larson's low) can be explained as cloud existence condition in external (galactic) gravitational field. This condition can be also applied to objects (clumps and cores) embedded into the cloud and its gravitational field. Derived existence condition do not rely on any internal dynamic of a cloud and embedded objects.

Double Neutron Stars: Evidence For Two Different Neutron-Star Formation Mechanisms - Six of the eight double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low orbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the electron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary systems, and not in single stars.

Large Scale Self-Similar Skeletal Structure of the Universe - An analysis of the redshift maps of galaxies and quasars has revealed large-scale self-similar skeletal structures of the Universe of the same topology which had been found earlier in a wide range of phenomena, spatial scales and environments. The "cartwheel" type of structure with diameter ~ 1.5 10^27 cm is discovered in this analysis by means of the method of multi-level dynamical contrasting. Similar skeletal structures in size up to 1.5 10^28 cm are found also in the redshift maps of quasars.

The Manin conjecture in dimension 2 - These lecture notes describe the current state of affairs for Manin's conjecture in the context of del Pezzo surfaces.

The impact of radio feedback from active galactic nuclei in cosmological simulations: Formation of disk galaxies - In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback. (abridged)

Y-formalism and $b$ ghost in the Non-minimal Pure Spinor Formalism of Superstrings - We present the Y-formalism for the non-minimal pure spinor quantization of superstrings. In the framework of this formalism we compute, at the quantum level, the explicit form of the compound operators involved in the construction of the $b$ ghost, their normal-ordering contributions and the relevant relations among them. We use these results to construct the quantum-mechanical $b$ ghost in the non-minimal pure spinor formalism. Moreover we show that this non-minimal $b$ ghost is cohomologically equivalent to the non-covariant $b$ ghost.

A multi-transition molecular line study of candidate massive young stellar objects associated with methanol masers - We characterize the molecular environment of candidate massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) signposted by methanol masers. Single pixel observations of 10 transitions of HCO^+, CO and CS isotopomers were carried out, using the IRAM 30m telescope. We studied a sample of 28 targets for which the 6.7GHz maser emission positions are known with a sub-arcsecond accuracy. The systemic velocity inferred from the optically thin lines agrees within 3km/s with the central velocity of the maser emission for most of the sources. About 64% of the sources show line wings in one or more transitions of CO, HCO^+ and CS species, indicating the presence of molecular outflows. Comparison of the widths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maser line traces the environment of MYSO of various kinematic regimes. Therefore conditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts of molecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer parts associated with molecular outflows. Calculations of the physical conditions based on the CO and HCO^+ lines and the CS line intensity ratios refine the input parameters for maser models.

Dynamics of the Tippe Top via Routhian Reduction - We consider a tippe top modeled as an eccentric sphere, spinning on a horizontal table and subject to a sliding friction. Ignoring translational effects, we show that the system is reducible using a Routhian reduction technique. The reduced system is a two dimensional system of second order differential equations, that allows an elegant and compact way to retrieve the classification of tippe tops in six groups as proposed in [1] according to the existence and stability type of the steady states.

Plasmaneutrino spectrum - Spectrum of the neutrinos produced in the massive photon and longitudal plasmon decay process has been computed with four levels of approximation for the dispersion relations. Some analytical formulae in limiting cases are derived. Interesting conclusions related to previous calculations of the energy loss in stars are presented. High energy tail of the neutrino spectrum is shown to be proportional to exp(-E/kT), where E is the neutrino energy and kT is the temperature of the plasma.

Quadratic BSDEs with random terminal time and elliptic PDEs in infinite dimension - In this paper we study one dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with random terminal time not necessarily bounded or finite when the generator F(t,Y,Z) has a quadratic growth in Z. We provide existence and uniqueness of a bounded solution of such BSDEs and, in the case of infinite horizon, regular dependence on parameters. The obtained results are then applied to prove existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to elliptic partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces.

Non-minimal Wu-Yang wormhole - We discuss exact solutions of three-parameter non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills model, which describe the wormholes of a new type. These wormholes are considered to be supported by SU(2)-symmetric Yang-Mills field, non-minimally coupled to gravity, the Wu-Yang ansatz for the gauge field being used. We distinguish between regular solutions, describing traversable non-minimal Wu-Yang wormholes, and black wormholes possessing one or two event horizons. The relation between the asymptotic mass of the regular traversable Wu-Yang wormhole and its throat radius is analysed.

Patterns of dominant flows in the world trade web - The large-scale organization of the world economies is exhibiting increasingly levels of local heterogeneity and global interdependency. Understanding the relation between local and global features calls for analytical tools able to uncover the global emerging organization of the international trade network. Here we analyze the world network of bilateral trade imbalances and characterize its overall flux organization, unraveling local and global high-flux pathways that define the backbone of the trade system. We develop a general procedure capable to progressively filter out in a consistent and quantitative way the dominant trade channels. This procedure is completely general and can be applied to any weighted network to detect the underlying structure of transport flows. The trade fluxes properties of the world trade web determines a ranking of trade partnerships that highlights global interdependencies, providing information not accessible by simple local analysis. The present work provides new quantitative tools for a dynamical approach to the propagation of economic crises.

Hydrogen 2p--2s transition: signals from the epochs of recombination and reionization - We propose a method to study the epoch of reionization based on the possible observation of 2p--2s fine structure lines from the neutral hydrogen outside the cosmological H {\sc ii} regions enveloping QSOs and other ionizing sources in the reionization era. We show that for parameters typical of luminous sources observed at $z \simeq 6.3$ the strength of this signal, which is proportional to the H {\sc i} fraction, has a brightness temperature $\simeq 20 \mu K$ for a fully neutral medium. The fine structure line from this redshift is observable at $\nu \simeq 1 \rm GHz$ and we discuss prospects for the detection with several operational and future radio telescopes. We also compute the characteristics of this signal from the epoch of recombination: the peak brightness is expected to be $\simeq 100 \mu K$; this signal appears in the frequency range 5-10 MHz. The signal from the recombination era is nearly impossible to detect owing to the extreme brightness of the Galactic emission at these frequencies.

Superconductor strip in a closed magnetic environment: exact analytic representation of the critical state - An exact analytic representation of the critical state of a current-carrying type-II superconductor strip located inside a cylindrical magnetic cavity of high permeability is derived. The obtained results show that, when the cavity radius is small, penetration of magnetic flux fronts is strongly reduced as compared to the situation in an isolated strip. From our generic representation it is possible to establish current profiles in closed cavities of various other geometries too by means of conformal mapping of the basic configuration addressed.

Near- and Far-Infrared Counterparts of Millimeter Dust Cores in the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D - The aim of this paper is to identify the young protostellar counterparts associated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through new IR observations (H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4 micron) along with an investigation performed on the existing IR catalogues. The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues (IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26 unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0 sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters, testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation. The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However, the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores, even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems to reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any property intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

High-precision covariant one-boson-exchange potentials for np scattering below 350 MeV - All realistic potential models for the two-nucleon interaction are to some extent based on boson exchange. However, in order to achieve an essentially perfect fit to the scattering data, characterized by a chi2/Ndata ~ 1, previous potentials have abandoned a pure one boson-exchange mechanism (OBE). Using a covariant theory, we have found a OBE potential that fits the 2006 world np data below 350 MeV with a chi2/Ndata = 1.06 for 3788 data. Our potential has fewer adjustable parameters than previous high-precision potentials, and also reproduces the experimental triton binding energy without introducing additional irreducible three-nucleon forces.

Pseudodifferential operators and weighted normed symbol spaces - In this work we study some general classes of pseudodifferential operators whose symbols are defined in terms of phase space estimates.

Entwining Structures in Monoidal Catrgories - Interpreting entwining structures as special instances of J. Beck's distributive law, the concept of entwining module can be generalized for the setting of arbitrary monoidal category. In this paper, we use the distributive law formalism to extend in this setting basic properties of entwining modules.

CP Violation and Arrows of Time Evolution of a Neutral $K$ or $B$ Meson from an Incoherent to a Coherent State - We study the evolution of a neutral $K$ meson prepared as an incoherent equal mixture of $K^0$ and $\bar{K^0}$. Denoting the density matrix by $\rho(t) = {1/2} N(t) [\1 + \vec{\zeta}(t) \cdot \vec{\sigma} ] $, the norm of the state $N(t)$ is found to decrease monotonically from one to zero, while the magnitude of the Stokes vector $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ increases monotonically from zero to one. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring monotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\gamma_L, \gamma_S$ and $\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\delta = \braket{K_L}{K_S}$, which is similar to, but weaker than, the known unitarity bound. A similar requirement on $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ yields a new bound, $\delta^2 < {1/2} (\frac{\Delta \gamma}{\Delta m}) \sinh (\frac{3\pi}{4} \frac{\Delta \gamma}{\Delta m})$ which is particularly effective in limiting the CP-violating overlap in the $B^0$-$\bar{B^0}$ system. We obtain the Stokes parameter $\zeta_3(t)$ which shows how the average strangeness of the beam evolves from zero to $\delta$. The evolution of the Stokes vector from $|\vec{\zeta}| = 0$ to $|\vec{\zeta}| = 1$ has a resemblance to an order parameter of a system undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Residual entropy in a model for the unfolding of single polymer chains - We study the unfolding of a single polymer chain due to an external force. We use a simplified model which allows to perform all calculations in closed form without assuming a Boltzmann-Gibbs form for the equilibrium distribution. Temperature is then defined by calculating the Legendre transform of the entropy under certain constraints. The application of the model is limited to flexible polymers. It exhibits a gradual transition from compact globule to rod. The boundary line between these two phases shows reentrant behavior. This behavior is explained by the presence of residual entropy.

Generalization of Einstein-Lovelock theory to higher order dilaton gravity - A higher order theory of dilaton gravity is constructed as a generalization of the Einstein-Lovelock theory of pure gravity. Its Lagrangian contains terms with higher powers of the Riemann tensor and of the first two derivatives of the dilaton. Nevertheless, the resulting equations of motion are quasi-linear in the second derivatives of the metric and of the dilaton. This property is crucial for the existence of brane solutions in the thin wall limit. At each order in derivatives the contribution to the Lagrangian is unique up to an overall normalization. Relations between symmetries of this theory and the O(d,d) symmetry of the string-inspired models are discussed.

Fluctuations of the partial filling factors in competitive RSA from binary mixtures - Competitive random sequential adsorption on a line from a binary mix of incident particles is studied using both an analytic recursive approach and Monte Carlo simulations. We find a strong correlation between the small and the large particle distributions so that while both partial contributions to the fill factor fluctuate widely, the variance of the total fill factor remains relatively small. The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite different between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger particle distribution being more correlated. The disparity in fluctuations of partial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional variance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the fluctuations in the size of gaps between larger particles. We discuss the implications of our results to semiconductor high-energy gamma detectors where the detector energy resolution is controlled by correlations in the cascade energy branching process.

Sur les repr\'esentations du groupe fondamental d'une vari\'et\'e priv\'ee d'un diviseur \`a croisements normaux simples - Given a projective variety X over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, we show that finite parabolic bundles along a fixed simple normal crossings divisor D are in one to one correspondence with representations of the \'etale fundamental group of X-D.

Infrared High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Post-AGB Circumstellar Disks. I. HR 4049 - The Winnowing Flow Observed? - High-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region is reported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR 4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and several H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the near-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission through the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region. The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer near the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and the spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar and M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity of $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar abundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance winnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the subsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the HR 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical AGB values: 12C/13C=6^{+9}_{-4} and 16O/17O>200.

Tannakian Categories attached to abelian Varieties - Starting from certain perverse sheaves on an abelian variety, including the intersection cohomology sheaves of curves and smooth ample divisors, we construct a semisimple super-Tannakian category.

On the Entropy Function and the Attractor Mechanism for Spherically Symmetric Extremal Black Holes - In this paper we elaborate on the relation between the entropy formula of Wald and the "entropy function" method proposed by A. Sen. For spherically symmetric extremal black holes, it is shown that the expression of extremal black hole entropy given by A. Sen can be derived from the general entropy definition of Wald, without help of the treatment of rescaling the AdS_2 part of near horizon geometry of extremal black holes. In our procedure, we only require that the surface gravity approaches to zero, and it is easy to understand the Legendre transformation of f, the integration of Lagrangian density on the horizon, with respect to the electric charges. Since the Noether charge form can be defined in an "off-shell" form, we define a corresponding entropy function, with which one can discuss the attractor mechanism for extremal black holes with scalar fields.

Dynamical layer decoupling in a stripe-ordered, high T_c superconductor - In the stripe-ordered state of a strongly-correlated two-dimensional electronic system, under a set of special circumstances, the superconducting condensate, like the magnetic order, can occur at a non-zero wave-vector corresponding to a spatial period double that of the charge order. In this case, the Josephson coupling between near neighbor planes, especially in a crystal with the special structure of La_{2-x}Ba_xCuO_4, vanishes identically. We propose that this is the underlying cause of the dynamical decoupling of the layers recently observed in transport measurements at x=1/8.

Cooling and heating by adiabatic magnetization in the Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ magnetic shape memory alloy - We report on measurements of the adiabatic temperature change in the inverse magnetocaloric Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ alloy. It is shown that this alloy heats up with the application of a magnetic field around the Curie point due to the conventional magnetocaloric effect. In contrast, the inverse magnetocaloric effect associated with the martensitic transition results in the unusual decrease of temperature by adiabatic magnetization. We also provide magnetization and specific heat data which enable to compare the measured temperature changes to the values indirectly computed from thermodynamic relationships. Good agreement is obtained for the conventional effect at the second-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. However, at the first order structural transition the measured values at high fields are lower than the computed ones. Irreversible thermodynamics arguments are given to show that such a discrepancy is due to the irreversibility of the first-order martensitic transition.

Giant Fluctuations of Coulomb Drag in a Bilayer System - We have observed reproducible fluctuations of the Coulomb drag, both as a function of magnetic field and electron concentration, which are a manifestation of quantum interference of electrons in the layers. At low temperatures the fluctuations exceed the average drag, giving rise to random changes of the sign of the drag. The fluctuations are found to be much larger than previously expected, and we propose a model which explains their enhancement by considering fluctuations of local electron properties.

Magnetic superelasticity and inverse magnetocaloric effect in Ni-Mn-In - Applying a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ alloy in the martensitic state induces a structural phase transition to the austenitic state. This is accompanied by a strain which recovers on removing the magnetic field giving the system a magnetically superelastic character. A further property of this alloy is that it also shows the inverse magnetocaloric effect. The magnetic superelasticity and the inverse magnetocaloric effect in Ni-Mn-In and their association with the first order structural transition is studied by magnetization, strain, and neutron diffraction studies under magnetic field.

SN 2003du: 480 days in the Life of a Normal Type Ia Supernova - An extensive set of optical and NIR photometry and low-resolution spectra the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. The observations started 13 days before B-band maximum light and continued for 480 days with exceptionally good time sampling. The optical photometry was calibrated through the S-correction technique. The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble those of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02) mag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988 (+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of standard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three methods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance modulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR bolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies that M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion. Modeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the range 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and NIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II ratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the blueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum spectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K doublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in Si II 6355, lines. We compare the time evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed SNe Ia and we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of Si II 6355 line in many SNe Ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

Outflow and Infall in a Sample of Massive Star Forming Regions - We present single pointing observations of SiO, HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope towards 23 massive star forming regions previously known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact HII regions. We detected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the other nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards 17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all sources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. For seven infall candidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and 2$\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show both SiO detections (young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources for which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect to current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey, we suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion may be important in describing the evolution of a massive protostar (or protostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.

Invariants of Welded Virtual Knots Via Crossed Module Invariants of Knotted Surfaces - We define an invariant of welded virtual knots from each finite crossed module by considering crossed module invariants of ribbon knotted surfaces which are naturally associated with them. We elucidate that the invariants obtained are non trivial by calculating explicit examples. We define welded virtual graphs and consider invariants of them defined in a similar way.

A Rational Approach to Resonance Saturation in large-Nc QCD - We point out that resonance saturation in QCD can be understood in the large-Nc limit from the mathematical theory of Pade Approximants to meromorphic functions. These approximants are rational functions which encompass any saturation with a finite number of resonances as a particular example, explaining several results which have appeared in the literature. We review the main properties of Pade Approximants with the help of a toy model for the <VV-AA> two-point correlator, paying particular attention to the relationship among the Chiral Expansion, the Operator Product Expansion and the resonance spectrum. In passing, we also comment on an old proposal made by Migdal in 1977 which has recently attracted much attention in the context of AdS/QCD models. Finally, we apply the simplest Pade Approximant to the <VV-AA> correlator in the real case of QCD. The general conclusion is that a rational approximant may reliably describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, but the same is not true in the Minkowski regime due to the appearance of unphysical poles and/or residues.

Unification and Fermion Mass Structure - Grand Unified Theories predict relationships between the GUT-scale quark and lepton masses. Using new data in the context of the MSSM, we update the values and uncertainties of the masses and mixing angles for the three generations at the GUT scale. We also update fits to hierarchical patterns in the GUT-scale Yukawa matrices. The new data shows not all the classic GUT-scale mass relationships remain in quantitative agreement at small to moderate tan beta. However, at large tan beta, these discrepancies can be eliminated by finite, tan beta-enhanced, radiative, threshold corrections if the gluino mass has the opposite sign to the wino mass.

Cluster tilting for one-dimensional hypersurface singularities - In this article we study Cohen-Macaulay modules over one-dimensional hypersurface singularities and the relationship with the representation theory of associative algebras using methods of cluster tilting theory. We give a criterion for existence of cluster tilting objects and their complete description by homological methods, using higher almost split sequences and results from birational geometry. We obtain a large class of 2-CY tilted algebras which are finite dimensional symmetric and satisfy $\tau^2=\id$. In particular, we compute 2-CY tilted algebras for simple and minimally elliptic curve singularities.

Gemini Mid-IR Polarimetry of NGC1068: Polarized Structures Around the Nucleus - We present diffraction limited, 10um imaging polarimetry data for the central regions of the archetypal Seyfert AGN, NGC1068. The position angle of polarization is consistent with three dominant polarizing mechanisms. We identify three distinct regions of polarization: (a) north of the nucleus, arising from aligned dust in the NLR, (b) south, east and west of the nucleus, consistent with dust being channeled toward the central engine and (c) a central minimum of polarization consistent with a compact (<22pc) torus. These observations provide continuity between the geometrically and optically thick torus and the host galaxy's nuclear environments. These images represent the first published mid-IR polarimetry from an 8-m class telescope and illustrate the potential of such observations.

Coupling between magnetic ordering and structural instabilities in perovskite biferroics: A first-principles study - We use first-principles density functional theory-based calculations to investigate structural instabilities in the high symmetry cubic perovskite structure of rare-earth (R $=$ La, Y, Lu) and Bi-based biferroic chromites, focusing on $\Gamma$ and $R$ point phonons of states with para-, ferro-, and antiferromagnetic ordering. We find that (a) the structure with G-type antiferromagnetic ordering is most stable, (b) the most dominant structural instabilities in these oxides are the ones associated with rotations of oxygen octahedra, and (c) structural instabilities involving changes in Cr-O-Cr bond angle depend sensitively on the changes in magnetic ordering. The dependence of structural instabilities on magnetic ordering can be understood in terms of how super-exchange interactions depend on the Cr-O-Cr bond angles and Cr-O bond lengths. We demonstrate how adequate buckling of Cr-O-Cr chains can favour ferromagnetism. Born effective charges (BEC) calculated using the Berry phase expression are found to be anomalously large for the A-cations, indicating their chemical relevance to ferroelectric distortions.

LNRF-velocity hump-induced oscillations of a Keplerian disc orbiting near-extreme Kerr black hole: A possible explanation of high-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 - At least four high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) at frequencies 41Hz, 67Hz, 113Hz, and 167Hz were reported in a binary system GRS 1915+105 hosting near-extreme Kerr black hole with a dimensionless spin a>0.98. We use the idea of oscillations induced by the hump of the orbital velocity profile (related to locally non-rotating frames - LNRF) in discs orbiting near-extreme Kerr black holes, which are characterized by a "humpy frequency" f_h, that could excite the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations with frequencies f_r, f_v. Due to non-linear resonant phenomena the combinational frequencies are allowed as well. Assuming mass M=14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998 for the GRS 1915+105 Kerr black hole, the model predicts frequencies f_h=41Hz, f_r=67Hz, (f_h+f_r)=108Hz, (f_v-f_r)=170Hz corresponding quite well to the observed ones. For black-hole parameters being in good agreement with those given observationally, the forced resonant phenomena in non-linear oscillations, excited by the "hump-induced" oscillations in a Keplerian disc, can explain high-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 within the range of observational errors.

Compton thick AGN in the Suzaku era - Suzaku observations of two hard X-ray (> 10 keV) selected nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies are presented. Both sources were clearly detected with the PIN Hard X-ray Detector up to several tens of keV, allowing for a fairly good characterization of the broad band X-ray continuum. Both sources are heavily obscured, one of which (NGC 5728) being Compton thick, while at lower energies the shape and intensity of the scattered/reflected continuum is very different. Strong iron Kalpha lines are detected in both sources. There are also hints for the presence of a broad relativistic iron line in NGC 4992.

Spin-dependence of Ce $4f$ hybridization in magnetically ordered systems: A spin-resolved photoemission study of Ce/Fe(110) - Spin- and angle-resolved resonant (Ce $4d\to4f$) photoemission spectra of a monolayer Ce on Fe(110) reveal spin-dependent changes of the Fermi-level peak intensities. That indicate a spin-dependence of $4f$ hybridization and, thus, of $4f$ occupancy and local moment. The phenomenon is described in the framework of the periodic Anderson model by $4f$ electron hopping into the exchange split Fe 3d derived bands that form a spin-gap at the Fermi energy around the $\bar{\Gamma}$ point of the surface Brillouin zone.

Two-way coupling of FENE dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow - We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations. Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to 20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both, increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate the local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.

A Novel String Derived Z' With Stable Proton, Light-Neutrinos and R-parity violation - The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally, such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation. The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number violating operators and R-parity violation.

Complexity of Janet basis of a D-module - We prove a double-exponential upper bound on the degree and on the complexity of constructing a Janet basis of a $D$-module. This generalizes a well known bound on the complexity of a Gr\"obner basis of a module over the algebra of polynomials. We would like to emphasize that the obtained bound can not be immediately deduced from the commutative case.

Evidence for a merger of binary white dwarfs: the case of GD 362 - GD 362 is a massive white dwarf with a spectrum suggesting a H-rich atmosphere which also shows very high abundances of Ca, Mg, Fe and other metals. However, for pure H-atmospheres the diffusion timescales are so short that very extreme assumptions have to be made to account for the observed abundances of metals. The most favored hypothesis is that the metals are accreted from either a dusty disk or from an asteroid belt. Here we propose that the envelope of GD 362 is dominated by He, which at these effective temperatures is almost completely invisible in the spectrum. This assumption strongly alleviates the problem, since the diffusion timescales are much larger for He-dominated atmospheres. We also propose that the He-dominated atmosphere of GD 362 is likely to be the result of the merger of a binary white dwarf.

Intersection local time for two independent fractional Brownian motions - We prove the existence of the intersection local time for two independent, d -dimensional fractional Brownian motions with the same Hurst parameter H. Assume d greater or equal to 2, then the intersection local time exists if and only if Hd<2.

Lapse of transmission phase and electron molecules in quantum dots - The puzzling behavior of the transition phase through a quantum dot can be understood in a natural way via a formation of the electron molecule in the quantum dot. In this case the resonance tunneling takes place through the quasi-stationary (doorway) state, which emerges when the number of electrons occupying the dot reaches a certain ``critical'' value, $N_{cr}$. Our estimation of this quantity agrees with the experimental data. The dependence of $N_{cr}$ on the dot's size is predicted as well.

Quantum-corrected black hole thermodynamics to all orders in the Planck length - We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized un- certainty principle (GUP) on black holes thermodynamics. We calculate the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy, and examine in details the Hawking evaporation process. As a result, the evaporation process is accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero entropy, zero heat capacity and finite non zero temperature black hole remnant (BHR). In particular we obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time, in comparison with the results obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading order in the Planck length.

Symmetry Breaking Study with Deformed Ensembles - A random matrix model to describe the coupling of m-fold symmetry in constructed. The particular threefold case is used to analyze data on eigenfrequencies of elastomechanical vibration of an anisotropic quartz block. It is suggested that such experimental/theoretical study may supply powerful means to discern intrinsic symmetries in physical systems.

The Measurement Calculus - Measurement-based quantum computation has emerged from the physics community as a new approach to quantum computation where the notion of measurement is the main driving force of computation. This is in contrast with the more traditional circuit model which is based on unitary operations. Among measurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way quantum computer stands out as fundamental. We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum computer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs, which we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning locally and compositionally about these patterns. We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form. Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems. Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models: Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory we develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework we have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is not just particular to the one-way quantum computer.

Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the presence of strong spin-orbit interactions - We have measured highly visible Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in a ring structure defined by local anodic oxidation on a p-type GaAs heterostructure with strong spin-orbit interactions. Clear beating patterns observed in the raw data can be interpreted in terms of a spin geometric phase. Besides h/e oscillations, we resolve the contributions from the second harmonic of AB oscillations and also find a beating in these h/2e oscillations. A resistance minimum at B=0T, present in all gate configurations, is the signature of destructive interference of the spins propagating along time-reversed paths.

Radio and X-ray nebulae associated with PSR J1509-5850 - We have discovered a long radio trail at 843 MHz which is apparently associated with middle age pulsar PSR J1509-5850. The radio trail has a length of ~7 arcmin. In X-rays, Chandra observations of PSR J1509-5850 reveal an associated X-ray trail which extends in the same orientation as the radio trail. Moreover, two clumpy structures are observed along the radio trail. The larger one is proposed to be the supernova remnant (SNR) candidate MSC 319.9-0.7. Faint X-ray enhancement at the position of the SNR candidate is found in the Chandra data.

Branching fraction and charge asymmetry measurements in B to J/psi pi pi decays - We study the decays B0 to J/psi pi+pi- and B+ to J/psi pi+pi0, including intermediate resonances, using a sample of 382 million BBbar pairs recorded by the BaBar detector at the PEP-II e+e- B factory. We measure the branching fractions B(B0 ->J/psi rho0) = (2.7 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.17) x 10-5 and B(B+ ->J/psi rho+) = (5.0 +/- 0.7 +/-0.31) x 10-5. We also set the following upper limits at the 90% confidence level: B(B0 -> J/psi pi+ \pi- non-resonant) < 1.2 x 10-5, B(B0 -> J/psi f_2(1270)) < 4.6 x 10-6, and B(B+ -> J/psi pi+ pi0 non-resonant) < 4.4 x 10-6. We measure the charge asymmetry in charged B decays to J/psi rho to be -0.11 +/- 0.12 +/- 0.08.

Text Line Segmentation of Historical Documents: a Survey - There is a huge amount of historical documents in libraries and in various National Archives that have not been exploited electronically. Although automatic reading of complete pages remains, in most cases, a long-term objective, tasks such as word spotting, text/image alignment, authentication and extraction of specific fields are in use today. For all these tasks, a major step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality and the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to aging, interfering lines),automatic text line segmentation remains an open research field. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of existing methods, developed during the last decade, and dedicated to documents of historical interest.

On the interpretation of muon-spin-rotation experiments in the mixed state of type-II superconductors - We argue that claims about magnetic field dependence of the magnetic field penetration depth lambda, which were made on the basis of moun-spin-rotation studies of some superconductors, originate from insufficient accuracy of theoretical models employed for the data analysis. We also reanalyze some of already published experimental data and demonstrate that numerical calculations of Brandt [E.H. Brandt, Phys. Rev. B 68, 54506 (2003)] may serve as a reliable and powerful tool for the analysis of the data collected in experiments with conventional superconductors. Furthermore, one can use this approach in order to distinguish between conventional and unconventional superconductors. It is unfortunate that these calculations have practically never been employed for such analyses.

Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs - We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical study of the space of proper colorings (solutions). We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree (number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses. First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine their asymptotic values for large number of colors. Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

Core-Corona Separation in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions - Simple geometrical considerations show that the collision zone in high energy nuclear collisions may be divided into a central part (``core''), with high energy densities, and a peripheral part (``corona''), with smaller energy densities, more like in pp or pA collisions. We present calculations which allow to separate these two contributions, and which show that the corona contribution is quite small (but not negligible) for central collisions, but gets increasingly important with decreasing centrality. We will discuss consequences concerning results obtained in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).

Numerical Evaluation of Six-Photon Amplitudes - We apply the recently proposed amplitude reduction at the integrand level method, to the computation of the scattering process 2 photons -> 4 photons, including the case of a massive fermion loop. We also present several improvements of the method, including a general strategy to reconstruct the rational part of any one-loop amplitude and the treatment of vanishing Gram-determinants.

Dynamics of shear homeomorphisms of tori and the Bestvina-Handel algorithm - Sharkovskii proved that the existence of a periodic orbit in a one-dimensional dynamical system implies existence of infinitely many periodic orbits. We obtain an analog of Sharkovskii's theorem for periodic orbits of shear homeomorphisms of the torus. This is done by obtaining a dynamical order relation on the set of simple orbits and simple pairs. We then use this order relation for a global analysis for a quantum chaotic physical system called the kicked accelerated particle.

Coniveau over $p$-adic fields and points over finite fields - If the $\ell$-adic cohomology of a projective smooth variety, defined over a $\frak{p}$-adic field $K$ with finite residue field $k$, is supported in codimension $\ge 1$, then any model over the ring of integers of $K$ has a $k$-rational point. This slightly improves our earlier result math/0405318: we needed there the model to be regular (but then our result was more general: we obtained a congruence for the number of points, and $K$ could be local of characteristic $p>0$).

Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization - This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning (PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.

On the Structure and Properties of Differentially Rotating Main-Sequence Stars in the 1-2 M_sun Range - We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass 1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results, including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like oscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some 1.5-2 M_sun stars.

SDSS J102146.44+234926.3: New WZ Sge-type dwarf nova - We report CCD photometry and spectroscopy during 2006 outburst of the dwarf nova SDSS J102146.44+234926.3 (SDSS J1021). The photographic plates from the MAO, SAI and CrAO plate archives, which cover the position of the SDSS J1021, were inspected for the presence of previous outbursts. We also present the BVRcIc photometric calibration of 52 stars in SDSS J1021 vicinity, which have V-magnitude in the range of 11.21-17.23m and can serve as comparison stars. The large amplitude of the SDSS J1021 outburst of 7m, superhumps with a period below the ''period gap'', rebrightening during the declining stage of superoutburst, rarity of outbursts and obtained spectrum allow to classify this object as a WZ Sge type dwarf nova.

Discrete phase space and minimum-uncertainty states - The quantum state of a system of qubits can be represented by a Wigner function on a discrete phase space, each axis of the phase space taking values in a finite field. Within this framework, we show that one can make sense of the notion of a "rotationally invariant state" of any collection of qubits, and that any such state is, in a well defined sense, a state of minimum uncertainty.

Turbulent Mixing in the Surface Layers of Accreting Neutron Stars - During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and ~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer, recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably, quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism. The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important for triggering and fueling superbursts. (abridged)

Wide-bandwidth, tunable, multiple-pulse-width optical delays using slow light in cesium vapor - We demonstrate an all-optical delay line in hot cesium vapor that tunably delays 275 ps input pulses up to 6.8 ns and 740 input ps pulses up to 59 ns (group index of approximately 200) with little pulse distortion. The delay is made tunable with a fast reconfiguration time (hundreds of ns) by optically pumping out of the atomic ground states.

Controllable Quantum Switchboard - All quantum information processes inevitably requires the explicit state preparation of an entangled state. Here we present the construction of a quantum switchboard which can act both as an optimal quantum cloning machine and a quantum demultiplexer based on the preparation of a four-qubit state.

The Galactic Center - In the past decade high resolution measurements in the infrared employing adaptive optics imaging on 10m telescopes have allowed determining the three dimensional orbits stars within ten light hours of the compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way. These observations show the presence of a three million solar mass black hole in Sagittarius A* beyond any reasonable doubt. The Galactic Center thus constitutes the best astrophysical evidence for the existence of black holes which have long been postulated, and is also an ideal `lab' for studying the physics in the vicinity of such an object. Remarkably, young massive stars are present there and probably have formed in the innermost stellar cusp. Variable infrared and X-ray emission from Sagittarius A* are a new probe of the physical processes and space-time curvature just outside the event horizon.

A geometric proof that $e$ is irrational and a new measure of its irrationality - We give a simple geometric proof that $e$ is irrational, using a construction of a nested sequence of closed intervals with intersection $e$. The proof leads to a new measure of irrationality for $e$: if $p$ and $q$ are integers with $q > 1$, then $|e - p/q| > 1/(S(q)+1)!$, where $S(q)$ is the smallest positive integer such that $S(q)!$ is a multiple of $q$. We relate this measure for $e$ to a known one and to the greatest prime factor of an integer. We make two conjectures and recall a theorem of Cantor that can be proved by a similar construction.

Scanning tunnelling microscopy for ultracold atoms - We propose a novel experimental probe for cold atomic gases analogous to the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) in condensed matter. This probe uses the coherent coupling of a single particle to the system. Depending on the measurement sequence, our probe allows to either obtain the \emph{local} density, with a resolution on the nanometer scale, or the single particle correlation function in real time. We discuss applications of this scheme to the various possible phases for a two dimensional Hubbard system of fermions in an optical lattice.

Center Manifold and Lie Symmetry Calculations on a Quasi-chemical Model for Growth-death Kinetics in Food - Food scientists at the U.S. Army's Natick Solider Center have developed a model for the lifecyle of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in intermediate moisture bread. In this article, we study this model using dynamical systems and Lie symmetry methods. We calculate center manifolds and Lie symmetries for different cases of parameter values and compare our results to those of the food scientists.

Absence of commensurate ordering at the polarization flop transition in multiferroic DyMnO3 - Ferroelectric spiral magnets DyMnO3 and TbMnO3 show similar behavior of electric polarization in applied magnetic fields. Studies of the field dependence of lattice modulations on the contrary show a completely different picture. Whereas in TbMnO3 the polarization flop from P||c to P||a is accompanied by a sudden change from incommensurate to commensurate wave vector modulation, in DyMnO3 the wave vector varies continuously through the flop transition. This smooth behavior may be related to the giant magnetocapacitive effect observed in DyMnO3.

Study of a finite volume - finite element scheme for a nuclear transport model - We consider a problem of nuclear waste contamination. It takes into account the thermal effects. The temperature and the contaminant's concentration fulfill convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The velocity and the pressure in the flow satisfy the Darcy equation, with a viscosity depending on both concentration and temperature. The equations are nonlinear and strongly coupled. Using both finite volume and nonconforming finite element methods, we introduce a scheme adapted to this problem. We prove the stability and convergence of this scheme and give some error estimates.

Realizable Hamiltonians for Universal Adiabatic Quantum Computers - It has been established that local lattice spin Hamiltonians can be used for universal adiabatic quantum computation. However, the 2-local model Hamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types of interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the present paper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to experimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic quantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known QMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local transverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is perhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for adiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered universal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling. We also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only 1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.

Quantitative size-dependent structure and strain determination of CdSe nanoparticles using atomic pair distribution function analysis - The size-dependent structure of CdSe nanoparticles, with diameters ranging from 2 to 4 nm, has been studied using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method. The core structure of the measured CdSe nanoparticles can be described in terms of the wurtzite atomic structure with extensive stacking faults. The density of faults in the nanoparticles ~50% . The diameter of the core region was extracted directly from the PDF data and is in good agreement with the diameter obtained from standard characterization methods suggesting that there is little surface amorphous region. A compressive strain was measured in the Cd-Se bond length that increases with decreasing particle size being 0.5% with respect to bulk CdSe for the 2 nm diameter particles. This study demonstrates the size-dependent quantitative structural information that can be obtained even from very small nanoparticles using the PDF approach.

Brane-world Quantum Gravity - The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference, allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can be tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of four-sub manifolds are briefly commented.

Isospin diffusion in thermal AdS/CFT with flavor - We study the gauge/gravity dual of a finite temperature field theory at finite isospin chemical potential by considering a probe of two coincident D7-branes embedded in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. The isospin chemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory. For the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green functions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We discuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond linear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical potential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.

Projective Hilbert space structures at exceptional points - A non-Hermitian complex symmetric 2x2 matrix toy model is used to study projective Hilbert space structures in the vicinity of exceptional points (EPs). The bi-orthogonal eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix are Puiseux-expanded in terms of the root vectors at the EP. It is shown that the apparent contradiction between the two incompatible normalization conditions with finite and singular behavior in the EP-limit can be resolved by projectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary normalization conditions correspond then to two different affine charts of this enlarged projective Hilbert space. Geometric phase and phase jump behavior are analyzed and the usefulness of the phase rigidity as measure for the distance to EP configurations is demonstrated. Finally, EP-related aspects of PT-symmetrically extended Quantum Mechanics are discussed and a conjecture concerning the quantum brachistochrone problem is formulated.

Excitation of the dissipationless Higgs mode in a fermionic condensate - The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson, becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode. The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.

Two characterizations of crooked functions - We give two characterizations of crooked functions: one based on the minimum distance of a Preparata-like code, and the other based on the distance-regularity of a crooked graph.

A Disciplined Approach to Adopting Agile Practices: The Agile Adoption Framework - Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the numerous benefits that it offers to an organization. Those benefits include, but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality, and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured process (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting agile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption Framework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption efforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of agile practices can and should be introduced.

Electronic structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg10Ir19B16 - Electronic structure of a novel superconducting noncentrosymmetric compound Mg10Ir19B16 was calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. Electronic part of the electron-phonon coupling constant, McMillan-Hopfield parameters, were calculated using the rigid-muffin-tin approximation (RMTA). The magnitude of the electron-phonon coupling constant, analysing atomic contributions, is discussed. Our results show, that superconductivity in Mg10Ir19B16 is presumably mediated by electron-phonon interaction.

Prospects of using simulations to study the photospheres of brown dwarfs - We discuss prospects of using multi-dimensional time-dependent simulations to study the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets, including the processes of convection, radiation, dust formation, and rotation. We argue that reasonably realistic simulations are feasible, however, separated into two classes of local and global models. Numerical challenges are related to potentially large dynamic ranges, and the treatment of scattering of radiation in multi-D geometries.

The exceptionally extended flaring activity in the X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 observed with Swift and XMM-Newton - We present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of Swift and XMM-Newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) GRB 050730. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposed intense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitude in time. Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks after the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well described by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s and t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. The temporal decay slopes before, between and after these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14) and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. The spectrum of the X-ray afterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with an absorbing column density N_H=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy. Strong X-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. In the majority of the flares (6/7) the ratio Delta_t/t_p between the duration of the event and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7. We showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first three flares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, as expected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshed shocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow moving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. The event fully satisfies the E_p-E_iso Amati relation while is not consistent with the E_p-E_jet Ghirlanda relation.

The obscured quasar population from optical, mid-infrared, and X-ray surveys - Over the last few years, optical, mid-infrared and X-ray surveys have brought to light a significant number of candidate obscured AGN and, among them, many Type 2 quasars, the long-sought after "big cousins'' of local Seyfert 2 galaxies. However, despite the large amount of multi-wavelength data currently available, a proper census and a panchromatic view of the obscured AGN/quasar population are still missing, mainly due to observational limitations. Here we provide a review of recent results on the identification of obscured AGN, focusing primarily on the population of Type 2 quasars selected in the optical band from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

The Realm of the First Quasars in the Universe: the X-ray View - We review the X-ray studies of the highest redshift quasars, focusing on the results obtained with Chandra and XMM-Newton. Overall, the X-ray and broad-band properties of z>4 quasars and local quasars are similar, suggesting that the small-scale X-ray emission regions of AGN are insensitive to the significant changes occurring at z=0-6.

The obscured X-ray source population in the HELLAS2XMM survey: the Spitzer view - Recent X-ray surveys have provided a large number of high-luminosity, obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), the so-called Type 2 quasars. Despite the large amount of multi-wavelength supporting data, the main parameters related to the black holes harbored in such AGN are still poorly known. Here we present the results obtained for a sample of eight Type 2 quasars in the redshift range 0.9-2.1 selected from the HELLAS2XMM survey, for which we used Ks-band, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS data at 24 micron to estimate bolometric corrections, black hole masses, and Eddington ratios.

IRAS 18317-0757: A Cluster of Embedded Massive Stars and Protostars - We present high-resolution, multiwavelength continuum and molecular-line images of the massive star forming region IRAS 18317-0757. The IR through mm spectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25 and 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous submm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which is associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser. In our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with total flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA cm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in the MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by 2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type (proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.

Photometry of the SW Sex-type nova-like BH Lyncis in high state - Aims: We present a photometric study of the deeply eclipsing SW Sex-type nova-like cataclysmic variable star BH Lyn Methods: Time-resolved V-band CCD photometry was obtained for seven nights between 1999 and 2004. Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the observations, BH Lyn was in high-state with V~15.5 mag. The star presents ~1.5 mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb. The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are detected in two long runs in 2000. A possible connection between SW Sex and negative superhump phenomena through the presence of tilted accretion disc is discussed, and a way to observationally test this is suggested.

General Doppler Shift Equation and the Possibility of Systematic Error in Calculation of Z for High Redshift Type Ia Supernovae - Systematic error in calculation of z for high redshift type Ia supernovae could help explain unexpected luminosity values that indicate an accelerating rate of expansion of the universe.

The Reverse Shock of SNR 1987A - The reverse shock of supernova remnant (SNR) 1987A emits in H-alpha and Ly-alpha, and comes in two flavors: surface and interior. The former is due to direct, impact excitation of hydrogen atoms crossing the shock, while the latter is the result of charge transfer reactions between these atoms and slower, post-shock ions. Interior and surface emission are analogous to the broad- and narrow-line components observed in Balmer-dominated SNRs. I summarize a formalism to derive line intensities and ratios in these SNRs, as well as a study of the transition zone in supernova shocks; I include an appendix where I derive in detail the ratio of broad to narrow H-alpha emission. Further study of the reverse shock emission from SNR 1987A will allow us to predict when it will vanish and further investigate the origins of the interior emission.

Carbon Nanostructures as an Electromechanical Bicontinuum - A two-field model provides an unifying framework for elasticity, lattice dynamics and electromechanical coupling in graphene and carbon nanotubes, describes optical phonons, nontrivial acoustic branches, strain-induced gap opening, gap-induced phonon softening, doping-induced deformations, and even the hexagonal graphenic Brillouin zone, and thus explains and extends a previously disparate accumulation of analytical and computational results.

3.8-Micron Photometry During the Secondary Eclipse of the Extrasolar Planet HD 209458b - We report infrared photometry of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b during the time of secondary eclipse (planet passing behind the star). Observations were acquired during two secondary eclipses at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in September 2003. We used a circular variable filter (1.5-percent bandpass) centered at 3.8 microns to isolate the predicted flux peak of the planet at this wavelength. Residual telluric absorption and instrument variations were removed by offsetting the telescope to nearby bright comparison stars at a high temporal cadence. Our results give a secondary eclipse depth of 0.0013 +/- 0.0011, not yet sufficient precision to detect the eclipse, whose expected depth is approximately 0.002 - 0.003. We here elucidate the current observational limitations to this technique, and discuss the approach needed to achieve detections of hot Jupiter secondary eclipses at 3.8 microns from the ground.

Ke4 decays and Wigner cusp - The NA48/2 experiment at the CERN SPS collected in 2003 and 2004 large samples of the decays K+- -> pi+ pi- e+- nu (Ke4+-), K+- -> pi0 pi0 e+- nu (Ke400) and K+- -> pi0 pi0 pi+-. From the Ke4+- form factors and from the cusp in the M00^2 distribution of the K+- -> pi0 pi0 pi+- events, the pi-pi scattering lengths a00 and a20 could be extracted. This measurement is a fundamental test of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). The branching fraction and form factors of the Ke400 decay were precisely measured, using a much larger data sample than in previous experiments. An improved measurement of the slope parameters for the decay K+- -> pi0 pi0 pi+- showed evidence for a non-zero value of k.

Antenna Combining for the MIMO Downlink Channel - A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is available to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink channel (single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter has very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user selection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.

Quantum State Transfer with Spin Chains - The thesis covers various aspects of quantum state transfer in permanently coupled spin systems.

Thistlethwaite's theorem for virtual links - The celebrated Thistlethwaite theorem relates the Jones polynomial of a link with the Tutte polynomial of the corresponding planar graph. We give a generalization of this theorem to virtual links. In this case, the graph will be embedded into a (higher genus) surface. For such graphs we use the generalization of the Tutte polynomial discovered by B.Bollobas and O.Riordan.

Colliding Branes and Formation of Spacetime Singularities - We construct a class of analytic solutions with two free parameters to the five-dimensional Einstein field equations, which represents the collision of two timelike 3-branes. We study the local and global properties of the spacetime, and find that spacelike singularities generically develop after the collision, due to the mutual focus of the two branes. Non-singular spacetime can be constructed only in the case where both of the two branes violate the energy conditions.

Hitting probabilities for systems of non-linear stochastic heat equations with multiplicative noise - We consider a system of d non-linear stochastic heat equations in spatial dimension 1 driven by d-dimensional space-time white noise. The non-linearities appear both as additive drift terms and as multipliers of the noise. Using techniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the one-point density of the solution u(t,x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on the two-point density of (u(s,y),u(t,x)). In particular, this estimate quantifies how this density degenerates as (s,y) converges to (t,x). From these results, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the process {u(t,x)}_{t \in \mathbb{R}_+, x \in [0,1]}, in terms of respectively Hausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to show that points are polar when d >6 and are not polar when d<6. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the range of the process is 6 when d>6, and give analogous results for the processes t \mapsto u(t,x) and x \mapsto u(t,x). Finally, we obtain the values of the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets of these processes.

Mutant knots and intersection graphs - We prove that if a finite order knot invariant does not distinguish mutant knots, then the corresponding weight system depends on the intersection graph of a chord diagram rather than on the diagram itself. The converse statement is easy and well known. We discuss relationship between our results and certain Lie algebra weight systems.

Acoustic resonances in microfluidic chips: full-image micro-PIV experiments and numerical simulations - We show that full-image micro-PIV analysis in combination with images of transient particle motion is a powerful tool for experimental studies of acoustic radiation forces and acoustic streaming in microfluidic chambers under piezo-actuation in the MHz range. The measured steady-state motion of both large 5 um and small 1 um particles can be understood in terms of the acoustic eigenmodes or standing ultra-sound waves in the given experimental microsystems. This interpretation is supported by numerical solutions of the corresponding acoustic wave equation.

Observations towards early-type stars in the ESO-POP survey: II -- searches for intermediate and high velocity clouds - We present CaII K and TiII optical spectra of early-type stars taken mainly from the UVES Paranal Observatory Project, plus HI 21-cm spectra from the Vila-Elisa and Leiden-Dwingeloo surveys, which are employed to obtain distances to intermediate and high velocity clouds. HI emission at a velocity of -117 km/s towards the sightline HD 30677 with NHI=1.7x10^19 cm-2 has no corresponding CaII K absorption, which has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 610. The star has a spectroscopically determined distance of 2.7-kpc, and hence sets this as a firm lower distance limit towards Anti-Centre cloud ACII. Towards another sightline (HD 46185), HI at +122 km/s and NHI=1.2x10^19 cm-2 is seen. The CaII K spectrum has a S/N = 780, although no absorption is observed at the cloud velocity. This similarly places a firm lower distance limit of 2.9-kpc towards this parcel of gas that may be an intermediate velocity cloud. The lack of intermediate velocity (IV) CaII K absorption towards HD 196426 at a S/N = 500 reinforces a lower distance limit of 700-pc towards this part of Complex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km/s. Additionally, no IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong in HI with NHI=8x10^19 cm-2 at -42 km/s, placing a firm although uninteresting lower distance limit of 39-pc to this part of IV South. Finally, no HV CaII K absorption is seen towards HD 115363 at a S/N = 410, placing a lower distance of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC gas at velocity of +224 km/s and NHI=5.2x10^19 cm-2. This gas is in the same region of the sky as complex WE (Wakker 2001), but at higher velocities. The non-detection of CaII K absorption sets a lower distance of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC, which is unsurprising if this feature is indeed related to the Magellanic System.

Physisorption of Nucleobases on Graphene - We report the results of our first-principles investigation on the interaction of the nucleobases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U) with graphene, carried out within the density functional theory framework, with additional calculations utilizing Hartree--Fock plus second-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory. The calculated binding energy of the nucleobases shows the following hierarchy: G > T ~ C ~ A > U, with the equilibrium configuration being very similar for all five of them. Our results clearly demonstrate that the nucleobases exhibit significantly different interaction strengths when physisorbed on graphene. The stabilizing factor in the interaction between the base molecule and graphene sheet is dominated by the molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive dispersion force to be induced between them. The present study represents a significant step towards a first-principles understanding of how the base sequence of DNA can affect its interaction with carbon nanotubes, as observed experimentally.

Low Density Lattice Codes - Low density lattice codes (LDLC) are novel lattice codes that can be decoded efficiently and approach the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In LDLC a codeword x is generated directly at the n-dimensional Euclidean space as a linear transformation of a corresponding integer message vector b, i.e., x = Gb, where H, the inverse of G, is restricted to be sparse. The fact that H is sparse is utilized to develop a linear-time iterative decoding scheme which attains, as demonstrated by simulations, good error performance within ~0.5dB from capacity at block length of n = 100,000 symbols. The paper also discusses convergence results and implementation considerations.

The Haunted Halos of Andromeda and Triangulum: A panorama of galaxy formation in action - We present a deep photometric survey of M31, conducted with the CFHT and INT, covering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc, and extending to M33. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very outermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale structures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least 150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/- 0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of scale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a challenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged]

Using conceptual metaphor and functional grammar to explore how language used in physics affects student learning - This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.

Supersymmetry versus Gauge Symmetry on the Heterotic Landscape - One of the goals of the landscape program in string theory is to extract information about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical correlations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated in field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string theory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper, we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be central to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge symmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these two kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string vacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the degree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities of realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string scale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that nearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet tachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level heterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.

Reversed flow at low frequencies in a microfabricated AC electrokinetic pump - Microfluidic chips have been fabricated to study electrokinetic pumping generated by a low voltage AC signal applied to an asymmetric electrode array. A measurement procedure has been established and followed carefully resulting in a high degree of reproducibility of the measurements. Depending on the ionic concentration as well as the amplitude of the applied voltage, the observed direction of the DC flow component is either forward or reverse. The impedance spectrum has been thoroughly measured and analyzed in terms of an equivalent circuit diagram. Our observations agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively, with theoretical models published in the literature.

Energy of 4-Dimensional Black Hole, etc - In this letter I suggest possible redefinition of mass density, not depending on speed of the mass element, which leads to a more simple stress-energy for an object. I calculate energy of black hole.

Multi-Higgs U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Three Dimensions - We study the three-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theory with $N$ Higgs fields numerically. This model is relevant to multi-component superconductors, antiferromagnetic spin systems in easy plane, inflational cosmology, etc. For N=2, the system has a second-order phase transition line $\tilde{c}_1(c_2)$ in the $c_2$(gauge coupling)$-c_1$(Higgs coupling) plane, which separates the confinement phase and the Higgs phase. For N=3, the critical line is separated into two parts; one for $c_2 \alt 2.25$ with first-order transitions, and the other for $c_2 \agt 2.25$ with second-order transitions.

Identifying Dark Matter Burners in the Galactic center - If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew adiabatically, then a dense "spike" of dark matter is expected to have formed around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. "WIMP burners", in the vicinity of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent limits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.

Instabilities in the time-dependent neutrino disc in Gamma-Ray Bursts - We investigate the properties and evolution of accretion tori formed after the coalescence of two compact objects. At these extreme densities and temperatures, the accreting torus is cooled mainly by neutrino emission produced primarily by electron and positron capture on nucleons (beta reactions). We solve for the disc structure and its time evolution by introducing a detailed treatment of the equation of state which includes photodisintegration of helium, the condition of beta-equilibrium, and neutrino opacities. We self-consistently calculate the chemical equilibrium in the gas consisting of helium, free protons, neutrons and electron-positron pairs and compute the chemical potentials of the species, as well as the electron fraction throughout the disc. We find that, for sufficiently large accretion rates (> 10 solar masses per second), the inner regions of the disk become opaque and develop a viscous and thermal instability. The identification of this instability might be relevant for GRB observations.

Complete integrable systems with unconfined singularities - We prove that any globally periodic rational discrete system in K^k(where K denotes either R or C), has unconfined singularities, zero algebraic entropy and it is complete integrable (that is, it has as many functionally independent first integrals as the dimension of the phase space). In fact, for some of these systems the unconfined singularities are the key to obtain first integrals using the Darboux-type method of integrability.

On the largest prime factor of the Mersenne numbers - Let P(k) be the largest prime factor of the positive integer k. In this paper, we prove that the series $\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{(\log n)^a}{P(2^n-1)}$ is convergent for each constant a<1/2, which gives a more precise form of a result of C. L. Stewart from 1977.

Developing the Galactic diffuse emission model for the GLAST Large Area Telescope - Diffuse emission is produced in energetic cosmic ray (CR) interactions, mainly protons and electrons, with the interstellar gas and radiation field and contains the information about particle spectra in distant regions of the Galaxy. It may also contain information about exotic processes such as dark matter annihilation, black hole evaporation etc. A model of the diffuse emission is important for determination of the source positions and spectra. Calculation of the Galactic diffuse continuum gamma-ray emission requires a model for CR propagation as the first step. Such a model is based on theory of particle transport in the interstellar medium as well as on many kinds of data provided by different experiments in Astrophysics and Particle and Nuclear Physics. Such data include: secondary particle and isotopic production cross sections, total interaction nuclear cross sections and lifetimes of radioactive species, gas mass calibrations and gas distribution in the Galaxy (H_2, H I, H II), interstellar radiation field, CR source distribution and particle spectra at the sources, magnetic field, energy losses, gamma-ray and synchrotron production mechanisms, and many other issues. We are continuously improving the GALPROP model and the code to keep up with a flow of new data. Improvement in any field may affect the Galactic diffuse continuum gamma-ray emission model used as a background model by the GLAST LAT instrument. Here we report about the latest improvements of the GALPROP and the diffuse emission model.

Prompt Emission of High Energy Photons from Gamma Ray Bursts - Within the internal shock scenario we consider different mechanisms of high energy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and derive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the prompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared within different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$). For very small values of $\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime. However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required to account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs are therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk Lorentz factor (e.g. $\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\sim 10$ GeV are attenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even higher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV - PeV due to $\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux level is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these photons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons.

On the classification of Floer-type theories - In this paper we outline a program for the classification of Floer-type theories, (or defining invariants of finite type for families). We consider Khovanov complexes as a local system on the space of knots introduced by V. Vassiliev and construct the wall-crossing morphism. We extend this system to the singular locus by the cone of this morphism and introduce the definition of the local system of finite type. This program can be further generalized to the manifolds of dimension 3 and 4.

Siegel's theorem for Drinfeld modules - We prove an analog of Siegel's theorem for integral points in the context of Drinfeld modules. The result holds for finitely generated submodules of the additive group over a function field of transcendence dimension 1.

On the Exponential Decay of the n-point Correlation Functions and the Analyticity of the Pressure - The goal of this paper is to provide estimates leading to a direct proof of the exponential decay of the n-point correlation functions for certain unbounded models of Kac type. The methods are based on estimating higher order derivatives of the solution of the Witten Laplacian equation on one forms associated with the hamiltonian of the system. We also provide a formula for the Taylor coefficients of the pressure that is suitable for a direct proof the analyticity.

A dynamical version of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for the additive group - We prove a dynamical version of the Mordell-Lang conjecture in the context of Drinfeld modules. We use analytic methods similar to the ones employed by Skolem, Chabauty, and Coleman for studying diophantine equations.

Fabrication of Analog Electronics for Serial Readout of Silicon Strip Sensors - A set of analog electronics boards for serial readout of silicon strip sensors was fabricated. A commercially available amplifier is mounted on a homemade hybrid board in order to receive analog signals from silicon strip sensors. Also, another homemade circuit board is fabricated in order to translate amplifier control signals into a suitable format and to provide bias voltage to the amplifier as well as to the silicon sensors. We discuss technical details of the fabrication process and performance of the circuit boards we developed.

On the reductive Borel-Serre compactification: $L^p$-cohomology of arithmetic groups (for large $p$) - The $L^2$-cohomology of a locally symmetric variety is known to have the topological interpretation as the intersection homology of its Baily-Borel Satake compactification. In this article, we observe that even without the Hermitian hypothesis, the $L^p$-cohomology of an arithmetic quotient, for $p$ finite and sufficiently large, is isomorphic to the ordinary cohomology of its reductive Borel-Serre compactification. We use this to generalize a theorem of Mumford concerning homogeneous vector bundles, their invariant Chern forms and the canonical extensions of the bundles; here, though, we are referring to canonical extensions to the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of any arithmetic quotient. To achieve that, we give a systematic discussion of vector bundles and Chern classes on stratified

The $^4$He total photo-absorption cross section with two- plus three-nucleon interactions from chiral effective field theory - The total photo-absorption cross section of $^4$He is evaluated microscopically using two- (NN) and three-nucleon (NNN) interactions based upon chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). The calculation is performed using the Lorentz integral transform method along with the {\em ab initio} no-core shell model approach. An important feature of the present study is the consistency of the NN and NNN interactions and also, through the Siegert theorem, of the two- and three-body current operators. This is due to the application of the $\chi$EFT framework. The inclusion of the NNN interaction produces a suppression of the low-energy peak and enhancement of the high-energy tail of the cross section. We compare to calculations obtained using other interactions and to representative experiments. The rather confused experimental situation in the giant resonance region prevents discrimination among different interaction models.

Comment on "Mass and Width of the Lowest Resonance in QCD" - I. Caprini's, G. Colangelo's, and H. Leutwyler's (CCL) article "Mass and Width of the Lowest Resonance in QCD", Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 132001 (2006) [hep-ph/0512364], is critically reviewed. The present comment is devoted to complement a recent experimental discussion (D.V. Bugg, J. Phys. G 34, 151 (2007) [hep-ph/0608081]) of short-comings in the CCL analysis, by presenting theoretical arguments pointing at a serious flaw in the theoretical formalism used by CCL, and also at the unlikeliness of their tiny error bars in the sigma-meson mass and width. The criticism made in the comment applies analogously to the analysis on the kappa-meson mass performed in the article "The K0*(800) scalar resonance from Roy-Steiner representations of pi K scattering" published as S. Descotes-Genon and B. Moussallam, Eur. Phys. J. C 48, 553 (2006) [hep-ph/0607133].

True and Apparent Scaling: The Proximity of the Markov-Switching Multifractal Model to Long-Range Dependence - In this paper, we consider daily financial data of a collection of different stock market indices, exchange rates, and interest rates, and we analyze their multi-scaling properties by estimating a simple specification of the Markov-switching multifractal model (MSM). In order to see how well the estimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data, we estimate and compare the scaling exponents $H(q)$ (for $q = 1, 2$) for both empirical data and simulated data of the estimated MSM models. In most cases the multifractal model appears to generate `apparent' long memory in agreement with the empirical scaling laws.

SkyMapper and the Southern Sky Survey - a resource for the southern sky - SkyMapper is amongst the first of a new generation of dedicated, wide-field survey telescopes. The 1.3m SkyMapper telescope features a 5.7 square degree field-of-view Cassegrain imager and will see first light in late 2007. The primary goal of the facility is to conduct the Southern Sky Survey a six colour, six epoch survey of the southern sky. The survey will provide photometry for objects between 8th and 23rd magnitude with global photometric accuracy of 0.03 magnitudes and astrometry to 50 mas. This will represent a valuable scientific resource for the southern sky and in addition provide a basis for photometric and astrometric calibration of imaging data.

Tautological classes on moduli spaces of curves with linear series and a push-forward formula when $\rho=0$ - We define tautological Chow classes on the moduli space of curves with linear series. In the case where the forgetful morphism to the moduli space of curves has relative dimension zero, we describe the images of these classes in the Chow group of Mgbar. As an application, we compute the (virtual) slopes of several different classes of divisors on Mgbar.

Equivariant symmetric bilinear torsions - We extend the main result in the previous paper of Zhang and the author relating the Milnor-Turaev torsion with the complex valued analytic torsion to the equivariant case.

Two-pion-exchange contributions to the pp\to pp\pi^0 reaction - Our previous study of the near-threshold pp\to pp\pi^0 reaction based on a hybrid nuclear effective field theory is further elaborated by examining the momentum dependence of the relevant transition operators. We show that the two-pion exchange diagrams give much larger contributions than the one-pion exchange diagram, even though the former is of higher order in the Weinberg counting scheme. The relation between our results and an alternative counting scheme, the momentum counting scheme, is also discussed.

Hardy and Rellich type inequalities with remainders for Baouendi-Grushin vector fields - In this paper we study Hardy and Rellich type inequalities for Baouendi-Grushin vector fields : $\nabla_{\gamma}=(\nabla_x, |x|^{2\gamma}\nabla_y)$ where $\gamma>0$, $\nabla_x$ and $\nabla_y$ are usual gradient operators in the variables $x\in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $y\in\mathbb{R}^k$, respectively. In the first part of the paper, we prove some weighted Hardy type inequalities with remainder terms. In the second part, we prove two versions of weighted Rellich type inequality on the whole space. We find sharp constants for these inequalities. We also obtain their improved versions for bounded domains.

Resummation Effects in the Search of SM Higgs Boson at Hadron Colliders - We examine the soft-gluon resummation effects, including the exact spin correlations among the final state particles, in the search of the Standard Model Higgs boson, via the process $gg\to H\to WW/ZZ \to 4 leptons, at the Tevatron and the LHC. A comparison between the resummation and the Next-to-Leading order (NLO) calculation is performed after imposing various kinematics cuts suggested in the literature for the Higgs boson search. For the $H\to ZZ$ mode, the resummation effects increase the acceptance of the signal events by about 25%, as compared to the NLO prediction, and dramatically alter various kinematics distributions of the final state leptons. For the $H\to WW$ mode, the acceptance rates of the signal events predicted by the resummation and NLO calculations are almost the same, but some of the predicted kinematical distributions are quite different. Thus, to precisely determine the properties of the Higgs boson at hadron colliders, the soft-gluon resummation effects have to be taken into account.

Triquark structure and isospin symmetry breaking in exotic Ds mesons - The color anti-triplet triquark $q\bar{q}\bar{q}$ is considered as a compact component in the tetraquark structure $cq\bar{q}\bar{q}$ of exotic $D_{s}$ mesons. We discuss the mass spectrum and the flavor mixing of the triquarks by using the instanton induced interaction and the one-gluon exchange potentials. As a characteristic property of the triquark, we investigate the isospin violation. It is shown that the flavor $\bar{\bf 3}$ (isosinglet) and $\bf 6$ (isotriplet) states may be strongly mixed and then are identified with $D_{s}(2632)$.

Prediction of future fifteen solar cycles - In the previous study (Hiremath 2006a), the solar cycle is modeled as a forced and damped harmonic oscillator and from all the 22 cycles (1755-1996), long-term amplitudes, frequencies, phases and decay factor are obtained. Using these physical parameters of the previous 22 solar cycles and by an {\em autoregressive model}, we predict the amplitude and period of the future fifteen solar cycles. Predicted amplitude of the present solar cycle (23) matches very well with the observations. The period of the present cycle is found to be 11.73 years. With these encouraging results, we also predict the profiles of future 15 solar cycles. Important predictions are : (i) the period and amplitude of the cycle 24 are 9.34 years and 110 ($\pm 11$), (ii) the period and amplitude of the cycle 25 are 12.49 years and 110 ($\pm$ 11), (iii) during the cycles 26 (2030-2042 AD), 27 (2042-2054 AD), 34 (2118-2127 AD), 37 (2152-2163 AD) and 38 (2163-2176 AD), the sun might experience a very high sunspot activity, (iv) the sun might also experience a very low (around 60) sunspot activity during cycle 31 (2089-2100 AD) and, (v) length of the solar cycles vary from 8.65 yrs for the cycle 33 to maximum of 13.07 yrs for the cycle 35.

Comparaison entre cohomologie cristalline et cohomologie \'etale $p$-adique sur certaines vari\'et\'es de Shimura - Let $X$ be an integral model at a prime $p$ of a Shimura variety of PEL type having good reduction, associated to a reductive group $G$. To $\mathbb{Z}_p$ reprsententations of the group $G$ can be associated two kinds of sheaves : crystals on the special fiber of $X$, and locally constant \'etale sheaves on the generic fiber. We establish a comparison between the cohomology of these two kinds of sheaves.

Large portfolio losses: A dynamic contagion model - Using particle system methodologies we study the propagation of financial distress in a network of firms facing credit risk. We investigate the phenomenon of a credit crisis and quantify the losses that a bank may suffer in a large credit portfolio. Applying a large deviation principle we compute the limiting distributions of the system and determine the time evolution of the credit quality indicators of the firms, deriving moreover the dynamics of a global financial health indicator. We finally describe a suitable version of the "Central Limit Theorem" useful to study large portfolio losses. Simulation results are provided as well as applications to portfolio loss distribution analysis.

Carleman estimates and unique continuation for second order parabolic equations with nonsmooth coefficients - This work is devoted to the strong unique continuation problem for second order parabolic equations with nonsmooth coefficients. Introduction and bibliography have been revised.

Specialized computer algebra system for application in general relativity - A brief characteristic of the specialized computer algebra system GRG_EC intended for symbolic computations in the field of general relativity is given.

Rigidly rotating dust solutions depending upon harmonic functions - We write down the relevant field equations for a stationary axially symmetric rigidly rotating dust source in such a way that the general solution depends upon the solution of an elliptic equation and upon harmonic functions. Starting with the dipole Bonnor solution, we built an asymptotically flat solution with two curvature singularities on the rotational axis with diverging mass. Apart from the two point singularities on the axis, the metric is regular everywhere. Finally, we study a non-asymptotically flat solution with NUT charge and a massless ring singularity, but with a well-defined mass-energy expression.

The Green function estimates for strongly elliptic systems of second order - We establish existence and pointwise estimates of fundamental solutions and Green's matrices for divergence form, second order strongly elliptic systems in a domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 3$, under the assumption that solutions of the system satisfy De Giorgi-Nash type local H\"{o}lder continuity estimates. In particular, our results apply to perturbations of diagonal systems, and thus especially to complex perturbations of a single real equation.

Supporting Knowledge and Expertise Finding within Australia's Defence Science and Technology Organisation - This paper reports on work aimed at supporting knowledge and expertise finding within a large Research and Development (R&D) organisation. The paper first discusses the nature of knowledge important to R&D organisations and presents a prototype information system developed to support knowledge and expertise finding. The paper then discusses a trial of the system within an R&D organisation, the implications and limitations of the trial, and discusses future research questions.

Reply to Comment on ``An Improved Experimental Limit on the Electric Dipole Moment of the Neutron'' - The Authors reply to the Comment of Golub and Lamoreaux. The experimental limit on the neutron electric dipole moment remains unchanged from that previously announced.

Lowest Landau Level of Relativistic Field Theories in a Strong Background Field - We consider gauge theories in a strong external magnetic like field. This situation can appear either in conventional four-dimensional theories, but also naturally in extra-dimensional theories and especially in brane world models. We show that in the lowest Landau level approximation, some of the coordinates become non-commutative. We find physical reasons to formal problems with non-commutative gauge theories such as the issue with SU(N) gauge symmetries. Our construction is applied to a minimal extension of the standard model. It is shown that the Higgs sector might be non-commutative whereas the remaining sectors of the standard model remain commutative. Signatures of this model at the LHC are discussed. We then discuss an application to a dark matter sector coupled to the Higgs sector of the standard model and show that here again, dark matter could be non-commutative, the standard model fields remaining commutative.

Mechanical and dielectric relaxation spectra in seven highly viscous glass formers - Published dielectric and shear data of six molecular glass formers and one polymer are evaluated in terms of a spectrum of thermally activated processes, with the same barrier density for the retardation spectrum of shear and dielectrics. The viscosity, an independent parameter of the fit, seems to be related to the high-barrier cutoff time of the dielectric signal, in accordance with the idea of a renewal of the relaxing entities after this critical time. In the five cases where one can fit accurately, the temperature dependence of the high-barrier cutoff follows the shoving model. The Johari-Goldstein peaks, seen in four of our seven cases, are describable in terms of gaussians in the barrier density, superimposed on the high-frequency tail of the $\alpha$-process. Dielectric and shear measurements of the same substance find the same peak positions and widths of these gaussians, but in general a different weight.

Computational and experimental imaging of Mn defects on GaAs (110) cross-sectional surface - We present a combined experimental and computational study of the (110) cross-sectional surface of Mn $\delta$-doped GaAs samples. We focus our study on three different selected Mn defect configurations not previously studied in details, namely surface interstitial Mn, isolated and in pairs, and substitutional Mn atoms on cationic sites (Mn$_{\rm Ga}$) in the first subsurface layer. The sensitivity of the STM images to the specific local environment allows to distinguish between Mn interstitials with nearest neighbor As atoms (Int$_{\rm As}$) rather than Ga atoms (Int$_{\rm Ga}$), and to identify the fingerprint of peculiar satellite features around subsurface substitutional Mn. The simulated STM maps for Int$_{\rm As}$, both isolated and in pairs, and Mn$_{\rm Ga}$ in the first subsurface layer are consistent with some experimental images hitherto not fully characterized.

Distance preserving mappings from ternary vectors to permutations - Distance-preserving mappings (DPMs) are mappings from the set of all q-ary vectors of a fixed length to the set of permutations of the same or longer length such that every two distinct vectors are mapped to permutations with the same or even larger Hamming distance than that of the vectors. In this paper, we propose a construction of DPMs from ternary vectors. The constructed DPMs improve the lower bounds on the maximal size of permutation arrays.

Hamiltonian Quantum Dynamics With Separability Constraints - Schroedinger equation on a Hilbert space ${\cal H}$, represents a linear Hamiltonian dynamical system on the space of quantum pure states, the projective Hilbert space $P {\cal H}$. Separable states of a bipartite quantum system form a special submanifold of $P {\cal H}$. We analyze the Hamiltonian dynamics that corresponds to the quantum system constrained on the manifold of separable states, using as an important example the system of two interacting qubits. The constraints introduce nonlinearities which render the dynamics nontrivial. We show that the qualitative properties of the constrained dynamics clearly manifest the symmetry of the qubits system. In particular, if the quantum Hamilton's operator has not enough symmetry, the constrained dynamics is nonintegrable, and displays the typical features of a Hamiltonian dynamical system with mixed phase space. Possible physical realizations of the separability constraints are discussed.

Planck Length and Cosmology - We show that an unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity implies that there is a fundamental length in Nature in the sense that no operational procedure would be able to measure distances shorter than the Planck length. Furthermore we give an explicit realization of an old proposal by Anderson and Finkelstein who argued that a fundamental length in nature implies unimodular gravity. Finally, using hand waving arguments we show that a minimal length might be related to the cosmological constant which, if this scenario is realized, is time dependent.

A Dynamic Algorithm for Blind Separation of Convolutive Sound Mixtures - We study an efficient dynamic blind source separation algorithm of convolutive sound mixtures based on updating statistical information in the frequency domain, andminimizing the support of time domain demixing filters by a weighted least square method. The permutation and scaling indeterminacies of separation, and concatenations of signals in adjacent time frames are resolved with optimization of $l^1 \times l^\infty$ norm on cross-correlation coefficients at multiple time lags. The algorithm is a direct method without iterations, and is adaptive to the environment. Computations on recorded and synthetic mixtures of speech and music signals show excellent performance.

Fast recursive filters for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems - A fast and accurate computational scheme for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems is presented. The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by a combination of components of only two different types: first-order low-pass filters and static nonlinearities. The parameters of these filters and nonlinearities may depend on system variables, and the topology of the system may be complex, including feedback. Several examples taken from neuroscience are given: phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation according to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The scheme uses two slightly different forms of autoregressive filters, with an implicit delay of zero for feedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for feedback control. On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal cell it computes, for a given level of accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than 4th-order Runge-Kutta. The computational scheme has minimal memory requirements, and is also suited for computation on a stream processor, such as a GPU (Graphical Processing Unit).

Spectra and symmetric eigentensors of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on $S^n$ - We compute the eigenvalues with multiplicities of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian acting on the space of symmetric covariant tensor fields on the Euclidian sphere $S^n$. The spaces of symmetric eigentensors are explicitly given.

CCD BV survey of 42 open clusters - We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy, it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow for simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42 observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate. The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is 3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8. Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5 and not younger than one relaxation time.

Geometry and Dynamics of Quantum State Diffusion - Riemannian metric on real 2n-dimensional space associated with the equation governing complex diffusion of pure states of an open quantum system is introduced and studied. Examples of a qubit under the influence of dephasing and thermal environments are used to show that the curvature of the diffusion metric is a good indicator of the properties of the environment dominated evolution and its stability.

Investigation of transit-selected exoplanet candidates from the MACHO survey - Context: Planets outside our solar system transiting their host star, i. e. those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the host star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined. Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained. Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys. Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a determination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a dynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements. Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the radial velocities and spectral analyses. Aims: We show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidates analysed in this work can be explained by eclipses of stellar objects, hence none of the five transiting objects is a planet.

On families of rational curves in the Hilbert square of a surface (with an Appendix by Edoardo Sernesi) - Under natural hypotheses we give an upper bound on the dimension of families of singular curves with hyperelliptic normalizations on a surface S with p_g(S) >0 via the study of the associated families of rational curves in Hilb^2(S). We use this result to prove the existence of nodal curves of geometric genus 3 with hyperelliptic normalizations, on a general K3 surface, thus obtaining specific 2-dimensional families of rational curves in its Hilbert square. We describe two infinite series of examples of general, primitively polarized K3's such that their Hilbert squares contain a IP^2 or a threefold birational to a IP^1-bundle over a K3. We discuss some consequences on the Mori cone of the Hilbert square of a general K3.

Anisotropy and Magnetic Field Effects on the Genuine Multipartite Entanglement of Multi-Qubit Heisenberg {\it XY} Chains - It has been shown that, for the two-qubit Heisenberg XY model, anisotropy and magnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite temperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite critical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit states. Recently, Mintert {\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters concurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a mathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this characteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and magnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit Heisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.

Double Helicity Asymmetry of Inclusive pi0 Production in Polarized pp Collisions at sqrt(s)=62.4GeV - The proton spin structure is not understood yet and there has remained large uncertainty on Delta g, the gluon spin contribution to the proton. Double helicity asymmetry (A_LL) of pi0 production in polarized pp collisions is used to constrain Delta g. In this report, preliminary results of A_LL of pi0 in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 62.4 GeV measured by PHENIX experiment in 2006 is presented. It can probe higer x region than the previously reported pi0 A_LL at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV thanks to the lower center of mass energy.

Time dependence of joint entropy of oscillating quantum systems - The time dependent entropy (or Leipnik's entropy) of harmonic and damped harmonic oscillators is extensively investigated by using time dependent wave function obtained by the Feynman path integral method. Our results for simple harmonic oscillator are in agrement with the literature. However, the joint entropy of damped harmonic oscillator shows remarkable discontinuity with time for certain values of damping factor. According to the results, the envelop of the joint entropy curve increases with time monotonically. This results is the general properties of the envelop of the joint entropy curve for quantum systems.

Tight bound on coherent states quantum key distribution with heterodyne detection - We propose a new upper bound for the eavesdropper's information in the direct and reverse reconciliated coherent states quantum key distribution protocols with heterodyne detection. This bound is derived by maximizing the leaked information over the symplectic group of transformations that spans every physical Gaussian attack on individual pulses. We exhibit four different attacks that reach this bound, which shows that this bound is tight. Finally, we compare the secret key rate obtained with this new bound to the homodyne rate.

Gaussian estimates for fundamental solutions of second order parabolic systems with time-independent coefficients - Auscher, McIntosh and Tchamitchian studied the heat kernels of second order elliptic operators in divergence form with complex bounded measurable coefficients on $\mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, in the case when $n=2$ they obtained Gaussian upper bound estimates for the heat kernel without imposing further assumption on the coefficients. We study the fundamental solutions of the systems of second order parabolic equations in the divergence form with bounded, measurable, time-independent coefficients, and extend their results to the systems of parabolic equations.

A Language-Based Approach for Improving the Robustness of Network Application Protocol Implementations - The secure and robust functioning of a network relies on the defect-free implementation of network applications. As network protocols have become increasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has become increasingly error-prone. In this paper, we present a domain-specific language, Zebu, for describing protocol message formats and related processing constraints. From a Zebu specification, a compiler automatically generates stubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to use, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu is also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally, Zebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation of the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and RTSP, we show that Zebu significantly improves application robustness.

A Close Look at Star Formation around Active Galactic Nuclei - We analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies at spatial resolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than 10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active - starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to 10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in fuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted. On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss, and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

Decrease of entanglement by local operations in the D\"ur-Cirac method - One cannot always obtain information about entanglement by the D\"ur-Cirac (DC) method. The impracticality is attributed to the decrease of entanglement by local operations in the DC method. We show that, even in 2--qubit systems, there exist states whose entangled property the DC method never evaluates. The class of such states in 2--qubit systems is completely characterized by the value of the fully entangled fraction. Actually, a state whose fully entangled fraction is less than or equal to 1/2 is always transformed into a separable state by local operations in the DC method, even if it has negative partial transposition.

Compton-thick AGN and the Synthesis of the Cosmic X-ray Background: the Suzaku Perspective - We discuss the abundance of Compton-thick AGN as estimated by the most recent population synthesis models of the cosmic X-ray background. Only a small fraction of these elusive objects have been detected so far, in line with the model expectations. The advances expected by the broad band detectors on board Suzaku are briefly reviewed.

Kibble-Zurek mechanism in a quenched ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate - The spin vortices are shown to be created through the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism in a quantum phase transition of a spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate, when the applied magnetic field is quenched below a critical value. It is shown that the magnetic correlation functions have finite correlation lengths, and magnetizations at widely separated positions grow in random directions, resulting in spin vortices. We numerically confirm the scaling law that the winding number of spin vortices is proportional to the square root of the length of the closed path, and for slow quench, proportional to $\tau_{\rm Q}^{-1/6}$ with $\tau_{\rm Q}$ being the quench time. The relation between the spin conservation and the KZ mechanism is discussed.

Triangulated categories without models - We exhibit examples of triangulated categories which are neither the stable category of a Frobenius category nor a full triangulated subcategory of the homotopy category of a stable model category. Even more drastically, our examples do not admit any non-trivial exact functors to or from these algebraic respectively topological triangulated categories.

U-max-Statistics - In 1948, W. Hoeffding introduced a large class of unbiased estimators called U-statistics, defined as the average value of a real-valued k-variate function h calculated at all possible sets of k points from a random sample. In the present paper we investigate the corresponding extreme value analogue, which we shall call U-max-statistics. We are concerned with the behavior of the largest value of such function h instead of its average. Examples of U-max-statistics are the diameter or the largest scalar product within a random sample. U-max-statistics of higher degrees are given by triameters and other metric invariants.

Dependence of exciton transition energy of single-walled carbon nanotubes on surrounding dielectric materials - We theoretically investigate the dependence of exciton transition energies on dielectric constant of surrounding materials. We make a simple model for the relation between dielectric constant of environment and a static dielectric constant describing the effects of electrons in core states, $\sigma$ bonds and surrounding materials. Although the model is very simple, calculated results well reproduce experimental transition energy dependence on dielectric constant of various surrounding materials.

Mpemba effect and phase transitions in the adiabatic cooling of water before freezing - An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect (that is, the freezing of initially hot water before cold one) is carried out, showing that in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3 +/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.

Effects of atomic interactions on Quantum Accelerator Modes - We consider the influence of the inclusion of interatomic interactions on the delta-kicked accelerator model. Our analysis concerns in particular quantum accelerator modes, namely quantum ballistic transport near quantal resonances. The atomic interaction is modelled by a Gross-Pitaevskii cubic nonlinearity, and we address both attractive (focusing) and repulsive (defocusing) cases. The most remarkable effect is enhancement or damping of the accelerator modes, depending on the sign of the nonlinear parameter. We provide arguments showing that the effect persists beyond mean-field description, and lies within the experimentally accessible parameter range.

How far is it to a sudden future singularity of pressure? - We discuss the constraints coming from current observations of type Ia supernovae on cosmological models which allow sudden future singularities of pressure (with the scale factor and the energy density regular). We show that such a sudden singularity may happen in the very near future (e.g. within ten million years) and its prediction at the present moment of cosmic evolution cannot be distinguished, with current observational data, from the prediction given by the standard quintessence scenario of future evolution. Fortunately, sudden future singularities are characterized by a momentary peak of infinite tidal forces only; there is no geodesic incompletness which means that the evolution of the universe may eventually be continued throughout until another ``more serious'' singularity such as Big-Crunch or Big-Rip.

Generalizing circles over algebraic extensions - This paper deals with a family of spatial rational curves that were introduced by Andradas, Recio and Sendra, under the name of hypercircles, as an algorithmic cornerstone tool in the context of improving the rational parametrization (simplifying the coefficients of the rational functions, when possible) of algebraic varieties. A real circle can be defined as the image of the real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise, and roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line ("the ${\mathbb{K}}$-axis") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension $\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\thickapprox\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation $\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\to\mathbb{K}(\alpha)$. The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of the specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely, via $\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a suitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at infinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of circles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the dimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many ${\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity. Moreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation of hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of curves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the simplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.

Decreasing families of dynamically determined intervals in the power-law family - We study the rate of growth of ratios of intervals delimited by the post-critical orbit of a map in the quasi-quadratic family $x\mapsto -|x|^\alpha +a.$ The critical order $\alpha$ is an arbitrary real number $\alpha>1.$ The range of the parameter $a$ is confined to an interval $(1,a_{\alpha})$ of length depending on the critical order. We prove that in every power-law family there is a unique parameter $p_{\alpha}$ corresponding to the kneading sequence $RLRRRLRC.$ Subsequently, we obtain monotonicity results concerning ratios of all intervals labeled by infinite post-critical orbit in the case of the kneading sequence $RLRL...$ This extends the results from \cite{P}, via refinement of the tools based on special properties of power-law mappings in non-euclidean metric.

Disorder effect on the Friedel oscillations in a one-dimensional Mott insulator - The Friedel oscillations resulting from coupling a quantum dot to one edge of a disordered one-dimensional wire in the Mott insulator regime, are calculated numerically using the DMRG method. By investigating the influence of the disorder on the Friedel oscillations decay we find that the effect of disorder is reduced by increasing the interaction strength. This behavior is opposite to the recently reported influence of disorder in the Anderson insulator regime, where disorder led to a stronger decay of the Friedel oscillations.

Description of the Scenario Machine - We present here an updated description of the "Scenario Machine" code. This tool is used to carry out a population synthesis of binary stars. Previous version of the description can be found at http://xray.sai.msu.ru/~mystery//articles/review/contents.html

Why do some intermediate polars show soft X-ray emission? A survey of XMM-Newton spectra - We make a systematic analysis of the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra of intermediate polars (IPs) and find that, contrary to the traditional picture, most show a soft blackbody component. We compare the results with those from AM Her stars and deduce that the blackbody emission arises from reprocessing of hard X-rays, rather than from the blobby accretion sometimes seen in AM Hers. Whether an IP shows a blackbody component appears to depend primarily on geometric factors: a blackbody is not seen in those that have accretion footprints that are always obscured by accretion curtains or are only visible when foreshortened on the white-dwarf limb. Thus we argue against previous suggestions that the blackbody emission characterises a separate sub-group of IPs which are more akin to AM Hers, and develop a unified picture of the blackbody emission in these stars.

Gutzwiller description of non-magnetic Mott insulators: a dimer lattice model - We introduce a novel extension of the Gutzwiller variational wavefunction able to deal with insulators that escape any mean-field like description, as for instance non-magnetic insulators. As an application, we study the Mott transition from a paramagnetic metal into a non-magnetic Peierls, or valence-bond, Mott insulator. We analyze this model by means of our Gutzwiller wavefunction analytically in the limit of large coordination lattices, where we find that: (1) the Mott transition is first order; (2) the Peierls gap is large in the Mott insulator, although it is mainly contributed by the electron repulsion; (3) singlet-superconductivity arises around the transition.

Velocity oscillations in actin-based motility - We present a simple and generic theoretical description of actin-based motility, where polymerization of filaments maintains propulsion. The dynamics is driven by polymerization kinetics at the filaments' free ends, crosslinking of the actin network, attachment and detachment of filaments to the obstacle interfaces and entropic forces. We show that spontaneous oscillations in the velocity emerge in a broad range of parameter values, and compare our findings with experiments.

Path integrals for stiff polymers applied to membrane physics - Path integrals similar to those describing stiff polymers arise in the Helfrich model for membranes. We show how these types of path integrals can be evaluated and apply our results to study the thermodynamics of a minority stripe phase in a bulk membrane. The fluctuation induced contribution to the line tension between the stripe and the bulk phase is computed, as well as the effective interaction between the two phases in the tensionless case where the two phases have differing bending rigidities.

Measuring CP violation in Bs->phi phi with LHCb - Sensitivity studies to the CP-violating parameters of the decay Bs->phi phi with the LHCb experiment are presented. The decay proceeds via a b->s s anti-s gluonic-penguin quark transition, which is sensitive to contributions from beyond the Standard Model particles. A time-dependent angular analysis of simulated data leads to an expected statistical uncertainty of 6 degrees on any new physics induced CP-violating phase for a sample corresponding to 2 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity. The expected precision on sin2beta from the related decay Bd->phi K0S is also discussed.

A Panchromatic Study of the Globular Cluster NGC 1904. I: The Blue Straggler Population - By combining high-resolution (HST-WFPC2) and wide-field ground based (2.2m ESO-WFI) and space (GALEX) observations, we have collected a multi-wavelength photometric data base (ranging from the far UV to the near infrared) of the galactic globular cluster NGC1904 (M79). The sample covers the entire cluster extension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) BSS has been detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core. No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the core. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by mass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the cluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall population.

Calculating Valid Domains for BDD-Based Interactive Configuration - In these notes we formally describe the functionality of Calculating Valid Domains from the BDD representing the solution space of valid configurations. The formalization is largely based on the CLab configuration framework.

Higgs and Z' Phenomenology in B-L extension of the Standard Model at LHC - The phenomenology of the low scale U(1)_{B-L} extension of the standard model and its implications at LHC is presented. In this model, an extra gauge boson corresponding to B-L gauge symmetry and an extra SM singlet scalar (heavy Higgs) are predicted. We show a detailed analysis of both heavy and light Higgses decay and production in addition to the possible decay channels of the new gauge boson. We find that the cross sections of the SM-like Higgs production are reduced by ~ 20%-30%, while its decay branching ratios remain intact. The extra Higgs has relatively small cross sections and the branching ratios of Z'-> l^+ l^- are of order ~20% compared to ~ 3% of the SM resuls. Hence, the search for Z' is accessible via a clean dilepton signal at LHC.

What Can be Learned Studying the Distribution of the Biggest Fragment ? - In the canonical formalism of statistical physics, a signature of a first order phase transition for finite systems is the bimodal distribution of an order parameter. Previous thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources produced in heavy-ion collisions provide information which support the existence of a phase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the observable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable order parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral collisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal behaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the constraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use the canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour with the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase transition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison allows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative comparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the Z1-E* plane which is in good agreement with that obtained with the signal of abnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat capacity).

The p-adic generalized twisted (h,q)-euler-l-function and its applications - The purpose of this paper is to construct the p-adic twisted (h,q)-Euler-l-function, which interpolates the twisted generalized twisted Euler numbers attached to chi at a negative integer.

Global coronal seismology - Following the observation and analysis of large-scale coronal wave-like disturbances, we discuss the theoretical progress made in the field of global coronal seismology. Using simple mathematical techniques we determine average values for magnetic field together with a magnetic map of the quiet Sun. The interaction between global coronal waves and coronal loops allows us to study loop oscillations in a much wider context, i.e. we connect global and local coronal oscillations.

La formule de Lie-Trotter pour les semi-groupes fortement continus - In this research project we presents the general properties, the spectral properties and the representation formulas for $C_0$-semigroups of linear operators in Banach spaces

Reconstructing the Intrinsic Triaxial Shape of the Virgo Cluster - To use galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, it is important to account for their triaxiality. Assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are induced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, Lee and Kang recently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axial ratio of a triaxial cluster. We examine the validity of this reconstruction algorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a target. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional projection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo Cluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major axis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member galaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified reconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of the triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with the recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm. It is also found that at the inner radii the shape tends to be more like prolate. We discuss the possible effect of the Virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.

Flat Pencils of Symplectic Connections and Hamiltonian Operators of Degree 2 - Bi-Hamiltonian structures involving Hamiltonian operators of degree 2 are studied. Firstly, pairs of degree 2 operators are considered in terms of an algebra structure on the space of 1-forms, related to so-called Fermionic Novikov algebras. Then, degree 2 operators are considered as deformations of hydrodynamic type Poisson brackets.

IR-active optical phonons in Pnma-1, Pnma-2 and R3c phases of LaMnO_{3+\delta} - Infrared-active phonons in LaMnO_{3+\delta} were studied by means of the reflection and transmission spectroscopy from 50 to 800 cm^{-1} at room temperature. Powder and ceramic samples of the phases of Pnma-2 (\delta=0.02), Pnma-1 (\delta=0.08), and R3c (\delta=0.15) were investigated. Besides, energies of the dipole-active phonons in Pnma-2, Pnma-1 phases were obtained by lattice-dynamics calculations. The transformations of IR-active phonons with the increase of \delta in the sequence of Pnma-2, Pnma-1, R3c are discussed.

Equivalences of Higher Derived Brackets - This note elaborates on Th. Voronov's construction [math/0304038,math/0412202] of $L_\infty$-structures via higher derived brackets with a Maurer-Cartan element. It is shown that gauge equivalent Maurer-Cartan elements induce $L_\infty$-isomorphic structures. Applications in symplectic, Poisson and Dirac geometry are discussed.

Neutron matter from low-momentum interactions - We present a perturbative calculation of the neutron matter equation of state based on low-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions. Our results are compared to the model-independent virial equation of state and to variational calculations, and we provide theoretical error estimates by varying the cutoff used to regulate nuclear interactions. In addition, we study the dependence of the BCS $^1$S$_0$ superfluid pairing gap on nuclear interactions and on the cutoff. The resulting gaps are well constrained by the nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, and the cutoff dependence is very weak for sharp or sufficiently narrow smooth regulators with cutoffs $\lm > 1.6 \fmi$.

Euclidean analysis of the entropy functional formalism - The attractor mechanism implies that the supersymmetric black hole near horizon solution is defined only in terms of the conserved charges and is therefore independent of asymptotic moduli. Starting only with the near horizon geometry, Sen's entropy functional formalism computes the entropy of an extreme black hole by means of a Legendre transformation where the electric fields are defined as conjugated variables to the electric charges. However, traditional Euclidean methods require the knowledge of the full geometry to compute the black hole thermodynamic quantities. We establish the connection between the entropy functional formalism and the standard Euclidean formalism taken at zero temperature. We find that Sen's entropy function 'f' (on-shell) matches the zero temperature limit of the Euclidean action. Moreover, Sen's near horizon angular and electric fields agree with the chemical potentials that are defined from the zero-temperature limit of the Euclidean formalism.

On the existence of chaotic circumferential waves in spinning disks - We use a third-order perturbation theory and Melnikov's method to prove the existence of chaos in spinning circular disks subject to a lateral point load. We show that the emergence of transverse homoclinic and heteroclinic points respectively lead to a random reversal in the traveling direction of circumferential waves and a random phase shift of magnitude $\pi$ for both forward and backward wave components. These long-term phenomena occur in imperfect low-speed disks sufficiently far from fundamental resonances.

First principles theory of chiral dichroism in electron microscopy applied to 3d ferromagnets - Recently it was demonstrated (Schattschneider et al., Nature 441 (2006), 486), that an analogue of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) experiment can be performed with the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The new phenomenon has been named energy-loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD). In this work we present a detailed ab initio study of the chiral dichroism in the Fe, Co and Ni transition elements. We discuss the methods used for the simulations together with the validity and accuracy of the treatment, which can, in principle, apply to any given crystalline specimen. The dependence of the dichroic signal on the sample thickness, accuracy of the detector position and the size of convergence and collection angles is calculated.

Probing MACHOs by observation of M31 pixel lensing with the 1.5m Loiano telescope - We analyse a series of pilot observations in order to study microlensing of (unresolved) stars in M31 with the 1.5m Loiano telescope, including observations on both identified variable source stars and reported microlensing events. We also look for previously unknown variability and discover a nova. We discuss an observing strategy for an extended campaign with the goal of determining whether MACHOs exist or whether all microlensing events are compatible with lens stars in M31.

Preconditioned Temporal Difference Learning - This paper has been withdrawn by the author. This draft is withdrawn for its poor quality in english, unfortunately produced by the author when he was just starting his science route. Look at the ICML version instead: http://icml2008.cs.helsinki.fi/papers/111.pdf

QCD thermodynamics and confinement from a dynamical quasiparticle point of view - In this study it is demonstrated that a simple picture of the QCD gluon liquid emerges in the dynamical quasiparticle model that specifies the active degrees of freedom in the time-like sector and yields a potential energy density in the space-like sector. By using the time-like gluon density (or scalar gluon density) as an independent degree of freedom - instead of the temperature $T$ as a Lagrange parameter - variations of the potential energy density lead to effective mean-fields for time-like gluons and an effective gluon-gluon interaction strength at low density. The latter yields a simple dynamical picture for the gluon fusion to color neutral glueballs when approaching the phase boundary from a temperature higher than $T_c$ and paves the way for an off-shell transport theoretical description of the parton dynamics.

Trellis-Coded Quantization Based on Maximum-Hamming-Distance Binary Codes - Most design approaches for trellis-coded quantization take advantage of the duality of trellis-coded quantization with trellis-coded modulation, and use the same empirically-found convolutional codes to label the trellis branches. This letter presents an alternative approach that instead takes advantage of maximum-Hamming-distance convolutional codes. The proposed source codes are shown to be competitive with the best in the literature for the same computational complexity.

Dynamic fracture of icosahedral model quasicrystals: A molecular dynamics study - Ebert et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3827 (1996)] have fractured icosahedral Al-Mn-Pd single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum and have investigated the cleavage planes in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Globular patterns in the STM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant structural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that they are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed currently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture simulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the propagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular dynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape of the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and how it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of dislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of the clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations perpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured samples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly influence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore have to be regarded as physical entities.

Preparation and detection of magnetic quantum phases in optical superlattices - We describe a novel approach to prepare, detect and characterize magnetic quantum phases in ultra-cold spinor atoms loaded in optical superlattices. Our technique makes use of singlet-triplet spin manipulations in an array of isolated double well potentials in analogy to recently demonstrated quantum control in semiconductor quantum dots. We also discuss the many-body singlet-triplet spin dynamics arising from coherent coupling between nearest neighbor double wells and derive an effective description for such system. We use it to study the generation of complex magnetic states by adiabatic and non-equilibrium dynamics.

Sobolev solution for semilinear PDE with obstacle under monotonicity condition - We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of a semilinear PDE's and also PDE's with obstacle under monotonicity condition. Moreover we give the probabilistic interpretation of the Sobolev's solutions in term of Backward SDE and reflected Backward SDE respectively.

Exact distribution of the sample variance from a gamma parent distribution - Several representations of the exact cdf of the sum of squares of n independent gamma-distributed random variables Xi are given, in particular by a series of gamma distribution functions. Using a characterization of the gamma distribution by Laha, an expansion of the exact distribution of the sample variance is derived by a Taylor series approach with the former distribution as its leading term. In particular for integer orders alpha some further series are provided, including a convex combination of gamma distributions for alpha = 1 and nearly of this type for alpha > 1. Furthermore, some representations of the distribution of the angle Phi between (X1,...,Xn) and (1,...,1) are given by orthogonal series. All these series are based on the same sequence of easily computed moments of cos(Phi).

Framework for non-perturbative analysis of a Z(3)-symmetric effective theory of finite temperature QCD - We study a three dimensional Z(3)-symmetric effective theory of high temperature QCD. The exact lattice-continuum relations, needed in order to perform lattice simulations with physical parameters, are computed to order O(a^0) in lattice perturbation theory. Lattice simulations are performed to determine the phase structure of a subset of the parameter space.

Constraints on Regge models from perturbation theory - We study the constraints that the operator product expansion imposes on large $N_c$ inspired QCD models for current-current correlators. We focus on the constraints obtained by going beyond the leading-order parton computation. We explicitly show that, assumed a given mass spectrum: linear Regge behavior in $n$ (the principal quantum number) plus corrections in $1/n$, we can obtain the logarithmic (and constant) behavior in $n$ of the decay constants within a systematic expansion in $1/n$. Our example shows that it is possible to have different large $n$ behavior for the vector and pseudo-vector mass spectrum and yet comply with all the constraints from the operator product expansion.

Asymptotic stability at infinity for bidimensional Hurwitz vector fields - Let $X:U-->R^2$ be a differentiable vector field. Set $Spc(X)={eigenvalues of DX(z) : z\in U}$. This $X$ is called Hurwitz if $Spc(X)\subset{z\in C:\Re(z)<0}$. Suppose that $X$ is Hurwitz and $U\subset R^2$ is the complement of a compact set. Then by adding to $X$ a constant $v$ one obtains that the infinity is either an attractor or a repellor for $X+v.$

Quantitative LEED I-V and ab initio study of the Si(111)-3x2-Sm surface structure and the missing half order spots in the 3x1 diffraction pattern - We have used Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) I-V analysis and ab initio calculations to quantitatively determine the honeycomb chain model structure for the Si(111)-3x2-Sm surface. This structure and a similar 3x1 recontruction have been observed for many Alkali-Earth and Rare-Earth metals on the Si(111) surface. Our ab initio calculations show that there are two almost degenerate sites for the Sm atom in the unit cell and the LEED I-V analysis reveals that an admixture of the two in a ratio that slightly favours the site with the lower energy is the best match to experiment. We show that the I-V curves are insensitive to the presence of the Sm atom and that this results in a very low intensity for the half order spots which might explain the appearance of a 3x1 LEED pattern produced by all of the structures with a 3x2 unit cell.

Renormalization of Hamiltonian QCD - We study to one-loop order the renormalization of QCD in the Coulomb gauge using the Hamitonian formalism. Divergences occur which might require counter-terms outside the Hamiltonian formalism, but they can be cancelled by a redefinition of the Yang-Mills electric field.

What made GRBs 060505 and 060614? - Recent observations of two nearby SN-less long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which share no obvious characteristics in their prompt emission, suggest a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. Here we briefly review the observational properties of these bursts and their proposed hosts, and discuss whether a new GRB classification scheme is needed.

A new, very massive modular Liquid Argon Imaging Chamber to detect low energy off-axis neutrinos from the CNGS beam. (Project MODULAr) - The paper is considering an opportunity for the CERN/GranSasso (CNGS) neutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with T2K and NOvA, to search for theta_13 oscillations and CP violation. Compared with large water Cherenkov (T2K) and fine grained scintillators (NOvA), the LAr-TPC offers a higher detection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels may be unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a 20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developed for the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we seek an extended international collaboration: (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn focussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC accelerator improvement program; (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis from the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is under consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth; (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an increase in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully considered. It is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a set of many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, "cloning" the technology of the T600. Further phases may foresee extensions of MODULAr to meet future physics goals. The experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided a new hall is excavated in the vicinity of the Gran Sasso Laboratory and adequate funding and participation are made available.

Momentum distributions in time-dependent density functional theory: Product phase approximation for non-sequential double ionization in strong laser fields - We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion. The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of approximating this functional significantly.

The Amadeus project at Dafne - The change of the hadron masses and hadron interactions in the nuclear medium and the structure of cold dense hadronic matter are hot topics of hadron physics today. These important, yet unsolved, problems will be the research field of AMADEUS (Antikaonic Matter At DAFNE: Experiments with Unraveling Spectroscopy) - new experiment proposal at DAFNE accelerator at LNF-INFN. AMADEUS will search for antikaon-mediated deeply bound nuclear states produced in helium by stopping K- from DAFNE, both in the formation and in the decay processes.

Measurements and analysis of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ on an underdoped and overdoped $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ compounds - The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ is one of the many non conventional properties of high-$T_c$ cuprates. It is possible that the $H_{c2}(T)$ anomalies are due to the presence of inhomogeneities in the local charge carrier density $\rho$ of the $CuO_2$ planes. In order to study this point, we have prepared good quality samples of polycrystalline $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_{4}$ using the wet-chemical method, which has demonstrated to produce samples with a better cation distribution. In particular, we have studied the temperature dependence of the second critical field, $H_{c2}(T)$, through the magnetization measurements on two samples with opposite average carrier concentration ($\rho_m=x$) and nearly the same critical temperature, namely $\rho_m = 0.08$ (underdoped) and $\rho_m = 0.25$ (overdoped). The results close to $T_c$ do not follow the usual Ginzburg-Landau theory and are interpreted by a theory which takes into account the influence of the inhomogeneities.

Thermal Hadronization and Hawking-Unruh Radiation in QCD - We conjecture that because of color confinement, the physical vacuum forms an event horizon for quarks and gluons which can be crossed only by quantum tunneling, i.e., through the QCD counterpart of Hawking radiation by black holes. Since such radiation cannot transmit information to the outside, it must be thermal, of a temperature determined by the chromodynamic force at the confinement surface, and it must maintain color neutrality. We explore the possibility that the resulting process provides a common mechanism for thermal hadron production in high energy interactions, from $e^+e^-$ annihilation to heavy ion collisions.

Photo-assisted shot noise in Coulomb interacting systems - We consider the fluctuations of the electrical current (shot noise) in the presence of a voltage time-modulation. For a non-interacting metal, it is known that the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise presents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems: 1) a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for which we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative, with a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2) a carbon nanotube for which a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.

A unified projection formalism for the Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal Xi-approximants and their metadislocations - The approximants xi, xi' and xi'_n of the quasicrystal Al-Mn-Pd display most interesting plastic properties as for example phason-induced deformation processes (Klein, H., Audier, M., Boudard, M., de Boissieu, M., Beraha, L., and Duneau, M., 1996, Phil. Mag. A, 73, 309.) or metadislocations (Klein, H., Feuerbacher, M., Schall, P., and Urban, K., 1999, Phys. Rev. Lett., 82, 3468.). Here we demonstrate that the phases and their deformed or defected states can be described by a simple projection formalism in three-dimensional space - not as usual in four to six dimensions. With the method we can interpret microstructures observed with electron microscopy as phasonic phase boundaries. Furthermore we determine the metadislocations of lowest energy and relate them uniquely to experimentally observed ones. Since moving metadislocations in the xi'-phase can create new phason-planes, we suggest a dislocation induced phase transition from xi' to xi'_n. The methods developed in this paper can as well be used for various other complex metallic alloys.

Light stops in the MSSM parameter space - We consider the regions of the MSSM parameter space where the top squarks become light and even may be the LSP. This happens when the triple scalar coupling A becomes very big compared to m_0. We show that in this case the requirement that the LSP is neutral imposes noticeable constraint on the parameter space excluding low m_0 and m_{1/2} similar to constraint from the Higgs mass limit. In some cases these constraints overlap. This picture takes place in a wide region of \tan\beta. In a narrow band close to the border line the stops are long-lived particles and decay into quarks and neutralino (chargino). The cross-section of their production at LHC via gluon fusion mechanism in this region may reach a few pb.

The blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: genuine blue stragglers or young stellar population? - Abridged... Blue stragglers (BSS) are thought to be the product of either primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a compilation of ground and space based photometry. Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo; and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv. The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies anti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the anti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than young main sequence stars.

Generalized characteristic polynomials of graph bundles - In this paper, we find computational formulae for generalized characteristic polynomials of graph bundles. We show that the number of spanning trees in a graph is the partial derivative (at (0,1)) of the generalized characteristic polynomial of the graph. Since the reciprocal of the Bartholdi zeta function of a graph can be derived from the generalized characteristic polynomial of a graph, consequently, the Bartholdi zeta function of a graph bundle can be computed by using our computational formulae.

Some invariants of pretzel links - We show that nontrivial classical pretzel knots L(p,q,r) are hyperbolic with eight exceptions which are torus knots. We find Conway polynomials of n-pretzel links using a new computation tree. As applications, we compute the genera of n-pretzel links using these polynomials and find the basket number of pretzel links by showing that the genus and the canonical genus of a pretzel link are the same.

Exact retrospective Monte Carlo computation of arithmetic average Asian options - Taking advantage of the recent litterature on exact simulation algorithms (Beskos, Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts) and unbiased estimation of the expectation of certain fonctional integrals (Wagner, Beskos et al. and Fearnhead et al.), we apply an exact simulation based technique for pricing continuous arithmetic average Asian options in the Black and Scholes framework. Unlike existing Monte Carlo methods, we are no longer prone to the discretization bias resulting from the approximation of continuous time processes through discrete sampling. Numerical results of simulation studies are presented and variance reduction problems are considered.

Rotationally-invariant slave-boson formalism and momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight - We generalize the rotationally-invariant formulation of the slave-boson formalism to multiorbital models, with arbitrary interactions, crystal fields, and multiplet structure. This allows for the study of multiplet effects on the nature of low-energy quasiparticles. Non-diagonal components of the matrix of quasiparticle weights can be calculated within this framework. When combined with cluster extensions of dynamical mean-field theory, this method allows us to address the effects of spatial correlations, such as the generation of the superexchange and the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight. We illustrate the method on a two-band Hubbard model, a Hubbard model made of two coupled layers, and a two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model (within a two-site cellular dynamical mean-field approximation).

On the failure of subadditivity of the Wigner-Yanase entropy - It was recently shown by Hansen that the Wigner-Yanase entropy is, for general states of quantum systems, not subadditive with respect to decomposition into two subsystems, although this property is known to hold for pure states. We investigate the question whether the weaker property of subadditivity for pure states with respect to decomposition into more than two subsystems holds. This property would have interesting applications in quantum chemistry. We show, however, that it does not hold in general, and provide a counterexample.

Symmetries and the cosmological constant puzzle - We outline the evaluation of the cosmological constant in the framework of the standard field-theoretical treatment of vacuum energy and discuss the relation between the vacuum energy problem and the gauge-group spontaneous symmetry breaking. We suggest possible extensions of the 't Hooft-Nobbenhuis symmetry, in particular, its complexification till duality symmetry and discuss the compatible implementation on gravity. We propose to use the discrete time-reflection transform to formulate a framework in which one can eliminate the huge contributions of vacuum energy into the effective cosmological constant and suggest that the breaking of time--reflection symmetry could be responsible for a small observable value of this constant.

The property of kappa-deformed statistics for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field: kappa parameter and kappa-distribution - We investigate the physical property of the kappa parameter and the kappa-distribution in the kappa-deformed statistics, based on Kaniadakis entropy, for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field. We derive two relations for the relativistic gas in the framework of kappa-deformed statistics, which describe the physical situation represented by the relativistic kappa-distribution function, provide a reasonable connection between the parameter kappa, the temperature four-gradient and the four-vector potential gradient, and thus present for the case kappa different from zero a clearly physical meaning. It is shown that such a physical situation is a meta-equilibrium state of the system, but has a new physical characteristic.

A KK-monopole giant graviton in AdS_5 x Y_5 - We construct a new giant graviton solution in AdS_5 x Y_5, with Y_5 a quasi-regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold, consisting on a Kaluza-Klein monopole wrapped around the Y_5 and with its Taub-NUT direction in AdS_5. We find that this configuration has minimal energy when put in the centre of AdS_5, where it behaves as a massless particle. When we take Y_5 to be S^5, we provide a microscopical description in terms of multiple gravitational waves expanding into the fuzzy S^5 defined as an S^1 bundle over the fuzzy CP^2. Finally we provide a possible field theory dual interpretation of the construction.

Critical Behavior of a Trapped Interacting Bose Gas - The phase transition of Bose-Einstein condensation is studied in the critical regime, when fluctuations extend far beyond the length scale of thermal de Broglie waves. Using matter-wave interference we measure the correlation length of these critical fluctuations as a function of temperature. The diverging behavior of the correlation length above the critical temperature is observed, from which we determine the critical exponent of the correlation length for a trapped, weakly interacting Bose gas to be $\nu=0.67\pm 0.13$. This measurement has direct implications for the understanding of second order phase transitions.

Tiling models for metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants - The AlPdMn quasicrystal approximants xi, xi', and xi'_n of the 1.6 nm decagonal phase and R, T, and T_n of the 1.2 nm decagonal phase can be viewed as arrangements of cluster columns on two-dimensional tilings. We substitute the tiles by Penrose rhombs and show, that alternative tilings can be constructed by a simple cut and projection formalism in three dimensional hyperspace. It follows that in the approximants there is a phasonic degree of freedom, whose excitation results in the reshuffling of the clusters. We apply the tiling model for metadislocations, which are special textures of partial dislocations.

Heisenberg antiferromagnet with anisotropic exchange on the Kagome lattice: Description of the magnetic properties of volborthite - We study the properties of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with spatially anisotropic nearest-neighbour exchange couplings on the kagome net, i.e. with coupling J in one lattice direction and couplings J' along the other two directions. For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magnetic properties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two kinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large manifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects self-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the original SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the dependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter kappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical calculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase diagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a decoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We corroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various phases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined by analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin perturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model leads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the ground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet, which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.

On the Nature of Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources from Optical/IR Measurements - We present a model for the prediction of the optical/infra-red emission from ULXs. In the model, ULXs are binary systems with accretion taking place through Roche lobe overflow. We show that irradiation effects and presence of an accretion disk significantly modify the optical/infrared flux compared to single stars, and also that the system orientation is important. We include additional constraints from the mass transfer rate to constrain the parameters of the donor star, and to a lesser extent the mass of the BH. We apply the model to fit photometric data for several ULX counterparts. We find that most donor stars are of spectral type B and are older and less massive than reported elsewhere, but that no late-type donors are admissable. The degeneracy of the acceptable parameter space will be significantly reduced with observations over a wider spectral range, and if time-resolved data become available.

Dephasing due to a fluctuating fractional quantum Hall edge current - The dephasing rate of an electron level in a quantum dot, placed next to a fluctuating edge current in the fractional quantum Hall effect, is considered. Using perturbation theory, we first show that this rate has an anomalous dependence on the bias voltage applied to the neighboring quantum point contact, because of the Luttinger liquid physics which describes the fractional Hall fluid. Next, we describe exactly the weak to strong backscattering crossover using the Bethe-Ansatz solution.

Fracture of complex metallic alloys: An atomistic study of model systems - Molecular dynamics simulations of crack propagation are performed for two extreme cases of complex metallic alloys (CMAs): In a model quasicrystal the structure is determined by clusters of atoms, whereas the model C15 Laves phase is a simple periodic stacking of a unit cell. The simulations reveal that the basic building units of the structures also govern their fracture behaviour. Atoms in the Laves phase play a comparable role to the clusters in the quasicrystal. Although the latter are not rigid units, they have to be regarded as significant physical entities.

Deformed Wigner crystal in a one-dimensional quantum dot - The spatial Fourier spectrum of the electron density distribution in a finite 1D system and the distribution function of electrons over single-particle states are studied in detail to show that there are two universal features in their behavior, which characterize the electron ordering and the deformation of Wigner crystal by boundaries. The distribution function has a $\delta$-like singularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density has a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent or vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations using exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner ordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger liquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it overestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the Luttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above features correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator conserving the particle number.

Curvature in Synthetic Differential Geometry of Groupoids - We study the fundamental properties of curvature in groupoids within the framework of synthetic differential geometry. As is usual in synthetic differential geometry, its combinatorial nature is emphasized. In particular, the classical Bianchi identity is deduced from its combinatorial one.

Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories? - In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the intrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly oriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible. However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of theories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates a significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not apply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the Hayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of this theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for the torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with the spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either ghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems can be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition choosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This yields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction principle is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does not couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There may be other torsion theories which do.

Structures in the Universe and Origin of Galaxies - The analysis of images (of obtained in various ranges of the lengths of waves) of luminous objects in the Universe by means of a method of multilevel dynamic contrasting led author to the conclusions: a) the structures of all observable galaxies represents a complicated constructions which have the tendency to self-similarity and made of separate (basic) blocks, which are a coaxially tubular structures and a cartwheel-like structures; b) the majority of observable objects in the Universe are luminous butt-ends of almost invisible (of almost completely transparent) of filamentary formations which structures are seen only near to their luminous butt-ends; c) the result of analysis of images of cosmic objects show the structure of many pairs of cooperating galaxies point to opportunity of their formation at butt-ends generated in a place of break of the similar filament; d) the interacting galaxies (M 81 and M 82) show they are butt-ends of sawed off of two branches of a treelike filament and their interaction is coming out through this filament; e) as our Universe is in dynamics the processes of formation of stars, galaxies and their congestions can go presently by means of a fracturing of filaments with a corresponding diameters and of the time for their such formation is necessary much less, than along existing standard model.

The classification ofseparable simple C*-algebras which are inductive limits of continuous-trace C*-algebraswith spectrum homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1] - A classification is given of certain separable nuclear C*-algebras not necessarily of real rank zero, namely, the class of separable simple C*-algebras which are inductive limits of continuous-trace C*-algebras whose building blocks have spectrum homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1], or to a disjoint union of copies of this space. Also, the range of the invariant is calculated.

U B V R I Photometry of Stellar Structures throughout the Disk of the Barred Galaxy NGC 3367 - We report new detailed surface U, B, V, R, and I photometry of 81 stellar structures in the disk of the barred galaxy NGC 3367. The images show many different structures indicating that star formation is going on in the most part of the disk. NGC 3367 is known to have a very high concentration of molecular gas distribution in the central regions of the galaxy and bipolar synchrotron emission from the nucleus with two lobes (at 6 kpc) forming a triple structure similar to a radio galaxy. We have determined the U, B, V, R, and I magnitudes and U - B, B - V, U - V, and V - I colors for the central region (nucleus), a region which includes supernovae 2003 AA, and 79 star associations throughout NGC 3367. Estimation of ages of star associations is very difficult due to several factors, among them: filling factor, metallicity, spatial distribution of each structure and the fact that we estimated the magnitudes with a circular aperture of 16 pixels in diameter, equivalent to $6''.8\sim1.4$ kpc. However, if the colors derived for NGC 3367 were similar to the colors expected of star clusters with theoretical evolutionary star tracks developed for the LMC and had a similar metallicity, NGC 3367 show 51 percent of the observed structures with age type SWB I (few tens of Myrs), with seven sources outside the bright surface brightness visible disk of NGC 3367.

Proton Decay Constraints on Low Scale AdS/CFT Unification - Dark matter candidates and proton decay in a class of models based on the AdS/CFT correspondence are discussed. We show that the present bound on the proton decay lifetime is inconsistent with ${\cal N} = 1$ SUSY, and strongly constrains ${\cal N} = 0$ non-SUSY, low scale trinification type unification of orbifolded AdS$\otimes S^5$ models.

BPS Black Holes - The entropy of BPS black holes in four space-time dimensions is discussed from both macroscopic and microscopic points of view.

Structure factors of harmonic and anharmonic Fibonacci chains by molecular dynamics simulations - The dynamics of quasicrystals is characterized by the existence of phason excitations in addition to the usual phonon modes. In order to investigate their interplay on an elementary level we resort to various one-dimensional model systems. The main observables are the static, the incoherent, and the coherent structure factor, which are extracted from molecular dynamics simulations. For the validation of the algorithms, results for the harmonic periodic chain are presented. We then study the Fibonacci chain with harmonic and anharmonic interaction potentials. In the dynamic Fibonacci chain neighboring atoms interact by double-well potentials allowing for phason flips. The difference between the structure factors of the dynamic and the harmonic Fibonacci chain lies in the temperature dependence of the phonon line width. If a bias is introduced in the well depth, dispersionless optic phonon bands split off.

Ground-Based Direct Detection of Exoplanets with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) - The Gemini Planet (GPI) imager is an "extreme" adaptive optics system being designed and built for the Gemini Observatory. GPI combines precise and accurate wavefront control, diffraction suppression, and a speckle-suppressing science camera with integral field and polarimetry capabilities. GPI's primary science goal is the direct detection and characterization of young, Jovian-mass exoplanets. For systems younger than 2 Gyr exoplanets more massive than 6 MJ and semimajor axes beyond 10 AU are detected with completeness greater than 50%. GPI will also discover faint debris disks, explore icy moons and minor planets in the solar system, reveal high dynamic range main-sequence binaries, and study mass loss from evolved stars. This white paper explains the role of GPI in exoplanet discovery and characterization and summarizes our recommendations to the NSF-NASA-DOE Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee ExoPlanet Task Force.

A Better Good-Turing Estimator for Sequence Probabilities - We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the size of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel sequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural scaling model.

Effective temperature vs line-depth ratio for ELODIE spectra. Gravity and rotational velocity effects - The dependence on the temperature of photospheric line-depth ratios (LDRs) in the spectral range 6190-6280 A is investigated by using a sample of 174 ELODIE Archive stellar spectra of luminosity class from V to III. The rotational broadening effect on LDRs is also studied. We provide useful calibrations of effective temperature versus LDRs for giant and main sequence stars with 3800<Teff<6000 K and vsini in the range 0-30 km/s. We found that, with the exception of very few line pairs, LDRs, measured at a spectral resolution as high as 42000, depend on vsini and that, by neglecting the rotational broadening effect, one can mistake the Teff determination of 100 K in the worst cases.

Chaos and Symmetry in String Cosmology - We review the recently discovered interplay between chaos and symmetry in the general inhomogeneous solution of many string-related Einstein-matter systems in the vicinity of a cosmological singularity. The Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type chaotic behaviour is found, for many Einstein-matter models (notably those related to the low-energy limit of superstring theory and M-theory), to be connected with certain (infinite-dimensional) hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. In particular, the billiard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure Einstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of 11-dimensional supergravity, are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests that these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding models. There even exists some evidence of a hidden equivalence between the general solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the infinite dimensional coset space E_{10} / K(E_{10}), where K(E_{10}) is the maximal compact subgroup of E_{10}.

Radio Emission from the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in the Globular Cluster G1 - We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) to search for radio emission from the globular cluster G1 (Mayall-II) in M31. G1 has been reported by Gebhardt et al. to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of ~2 x 10^4 solar masses. Radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the cluster center with an 8.4 GHz power of 2 x 10^{15} W/Hz. The radio/X-ray ratio of G1 is a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binary in the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretion onto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possible candidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivity VLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. If the radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occur for hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters, they are within reach of the current VLA and should be detectable easily by the Expanded VLA when it comes on line in 2010.

Even infinite dimensional real Banach spaces - This article is a continuation of a paper of the first author \cite{F} about complex structures on real Banach spaces. We define a notion of even infinite dimensional real Banach space, and prove that there exist even spaces, including HI or unconditional examples from \cite{F} and $C(K)$ examples due to Plebanek \cite{P}. We extend results of \cite{F} relating the set of complex structures up to isomorphism on a real space to a group associated to inessential operators on that space, and give characterizations of even spaces in terms of this group. We also generalize results of \cite{F} about totally incomparable complex structures to essentially incomparable complex structures, while showing that the complex version of a space defined by S. Argyros and A. Manoussakis \cite{AM} provide examples of essentially incomparable complex structures which are not totally incomparable.

Landau-Lifshitz sigma-models, fermions and the AdS/CFT correspondence - We define Landau-Lifshitz sigma models on general coset space $G/H$, with $H$ a maximal stability sub-group of $G$. These are non-relativistic models that have $G$-valued N\"other charges, local $H$ invariance and are classically integrable. Using this definition, we construct the $PSU(2,2|4)/PS(U(2|2)^2)$ Landau-Lifshitz sigma-model. This sigma model describes the thermodynamic limit of the spin-chain Hamiltonian obtained from the complete one-loop dilatation operator of the N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. In the second part of the paper, we identify a number of consistent truncations of the Type IIB Green-Schwarz action on $AdS_5\times S^5$ whose field content consists of two real bosons and 4,8 or 16 real fermions. We show that $\kappa$-symmetry acts trivially in these sub-sectors. In the context of the large spin limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we map the Lagrangians of these sub-sectors to corresponding truncations of the $PSU(2,2|4)/PS(U(2|2)^2)$ Landau-Lifshitz sigma-model.

Trajectory of neutron$-$neutron$-^{18}C$ excited three-body state - The trajectory of the first excited Efimov state is investigated by using a renormalized zero-range three-body model for a system with two bound and one virtual two-body subsystems. The approach is applied to $n-n-^{18}$C, where the $n-n$ virtual energy and the three-body ground state are kept fixed. It is shown that such three-body excited state goes from a bound to a virtual state when the $n-^{18}$C binding energy is increased. Results obtained for the $n-^{19}$C elastic cross-section at low energies also show dominance of an $S-$matrix pole corresponding to a bound or virtual Efimov state. It is also presented a brief discussion of these findings in the context of ultracold atom physics with tunable scattering lengths.

Physical parameters of evolved stars in clusters and in the field from line-depth ratios - We present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of two samples of evolved stars selected in the field and in the intermediate-age open cluster IC 4651, for which detailed measurements of chemical composition were made in the last few years. Applying the Gray's method based on ratios of line depths, we determine the effective temperature and compare our results with previous ones obtained by means of the curves of growth of iron lines. The knowledge of the temperature enables us to estimate other fundamental stellar parameters, such as color excess, age, and mass.

Large deviations of Poisson cluster processes - In this paper we prove scalar and sample path large deviation principles for a large class of Poisson cluster processes. As a consequence, we provide a large deviation principle for ergodic Hawkes point processes.

Distributed quantum information processing with minimal local resources - We present a protocol for growing graph states, the resource for one-way quantum computing, when the available entanglement mechanism is highly imperfect. The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits, requiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli error, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce local resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of purification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a biased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more rapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented of how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a single Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\sim 10$ times the imperfection in local operations.

X-Raying the MOJAVE Sample of Compact Extragalactic Radio Jets - The MOJAVE sample is the first large radio-selected, VLBI-monitored AGN sample for which complete X-ray spectral information is being gathered. We report on the status of Swift survey observations which complement the available archival X-ray data at 0.3-10 keV and in the UV with its XRT and UVOT instruments. Many of these 133 radio-brightest AGN in the northern sky are now being observed for the first time at these energies. These and complementary other multi-wavelength observations provide a large statistical sample of radio-selected AGN whose spectral energy distributions are measured from radio to gamma-ray wavelengths, available at the beginning of GLAST operations in 2008. Here, we report the X-ray spectral characteristics of 36 of these previously unobserved MOJAVE sources. In addition, the number of MOJAVE sources detected by the BAT instrument in the hard X-ray band is growing: we report the detection of five new blazars with BAT.

Sparse Estimators and the Oracle Property, or the Return of Hodges' Estimator - We point out some pitfalls related to the concept of an oracle property as used in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known pitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator introduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather poorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to maximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator is tuned to sparsity.

Capillary ordering and layering transitions in two-dimensional hard-rod fluids - In this article we calculate the surface phase diagram of a two-dimensional hard-rod fluid confined between two hard lines. In a first stage we study the semi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single hard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the wall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard walls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition. For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even for very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model used was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure Functional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation approximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked experimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical motions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between the grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which entropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface phenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.

Generation of Entanglement Outside of the Light Cone - The Feynman propagator has nonzero values outside of the forward light cone. That does not allow messages to be transmitted faster than the speed of light, but it is shown here that it does allow entanglement and mutual information to be generated at space-like separated points. These effects can be interpreted as being due to the propagation of virtual photons outside of the light cone or as a transfer of pre-existing entanglement from the quantum vacuum. The differences between these two interpretations are discussed.

Monte Carlo Simulations of Quantum Spin Systems in the Valence Bond Basis - We discuss a projector Monte Carlo method for quantum spin models formulated in the valence bond basis, using the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet as an example. Its singlet ground state can be projected out of an arbitrary basis state as the trial state, but a more rapid convergence can be obtained using a good variational state. As an alternative to first carrying out a time consuming variational Monte Carlo calculation, we show that a very good trial state can be generated in an iterative fashion in the course of the simulation itself. We also show how the properties of the valence bond basis enable calculations of quantities that are difficult to obtain with the standard basis of Sz eigenstates. In particular, we discuss quantities involving finite-momentum states in the triplet sector, such as the dispersion relation and the spectral weight of the lowest triplet.

N-dimensional sl(2)-coalgebra spaces with non-constant curvature - An infinite family of ND spaces endowed with sl(2)-coalgebra symmetry is introduced. For all these spaces the geodesic flow is superintegrable, and the explicit form of their common set of integrals is obtained from the underlying sl(2)-coalgebra structure. In particular, ND spherically symmetric spaces with Euclidean signature are shown to be sl(2)-coalgebra spaces. As a byproduct of this construction we present ND generalizations of the classical Darboux surfaces, thus obtaining remarkable superintegrable ND spaces with non-constant curvature.

The Generalized PT-Symmetric Sinh-Gordon Potential Solvable within Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Formalism - The generalized Sinh-Gordon potential is solved within quantum Hamiltonian Jacobi approach in the framework of PT symmetry. The quasi exact solutions of energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the generalized Sinh-Gordon potential are found for n=0,1 states.

Emergence of U(1) symmetry in the 3D XY model with Zq anisotropy - We study the three-dimensional XY model with a Z_q anisotropic term. At temperatures T < Tc this dangerously irrelevant perturbation is relevant only above a length scale Lambda, which diverges as a power of the correlation length; Lambda ~ xi^a_q. Below Lambda the order parameter is U(1) symmetric. We derive the full scaling function controlling the emergence of U(1) symmetry and use Monte Carlo results to extract the exponent a_q for q=4,...,8. We find that a_q = a_4 (q/4)^2, with a_4 only marginally larger than 1. We discuss these results in the context of U(1) symmetry at "deconfined" quantum critical points separating antiferromagnetic and valence-bond-solid states in quantum spin systems.

Existence of Universal Entangler - A gate is called entangler if it transforms some (pure) product states to entangled states. A universal entangler is a gate which transforms all product states to entangled states. In practice, a universal entangler is a very powerful device for generating entanglements, and thus provides important physical resources for accomplishing many tasks in quantum computing and quantum information. This Letter demonstrates that a universal entangler always exists except for a degenerated case. Nevertheless, the problem how to find a universal entangler remains open.

Fan-shaped and toric textures of mesomorphic oxadiazoles - When a family of non symmetrical heterocycled compounds is investigated, a variety of mesophases can be observed with rather different features. Here we report the behaviour of seven different members among a family of such materials, that consists of mesomorphic oxadiazole compounds. In two of these compounds, the optical microscope investigation shows very interesting behaviours. In their smectic phases, fan-shaped and toric textures, sometimes with periodic instability, are observed. Moreover, the nematic phase displays a texture transition. Texture transitions have been previously observed only inside the nematic phase of some compounds belonging to the families of the oxybenzoic and cyclohexane acids. In these two oxadiazole compounds we can observe what we define as a "toric nematic phase", heating the samples from the smectic phase. The toric nematic texture disappears as the sample is further heated, changing into a smooth texture.

Williams' decomposition of the L\'evy continuous random tree and simultaneous extinction probability for populations with neutral mutations - We consider an initial Eve-population and a population of neutral mutants, such that the total population dies out in finite time. We describe the evolution of the Eve-population and the total population with continuous state branching processes, and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an immigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population. First we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total population given by a continuous random tree, according to the ancestral lineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for the probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total population.

TeV-scale gravity in Horava-Witten theory on a compact complex hyperbolic threefold - The field equations and boundary conditions of Horava-Witten theory, compactified on a smooth compact spin quotient of CH^3, where CH^3 denotes the hyperbolic cousin of CP^3, are studied in the presence of Casimir energy density terms. If the Casimir energy densities near one boundary result in a certain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10^5 in units of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is found that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary becoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative ways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized consistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant are considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13} in units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed cosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions have reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer surface, and there are Casimir effects near the outer surface. In the third alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region by extra fluxes of the three-form gauge field, whose four-form field strength wraps three-cycles of the compact six-manifold times the radial dimension of the thick pipe. Some problems related to fitting the strong/electroweak Standard Model are considered.

Balance of forces in simulated bilayers - Two kinds of simulated bilayers are described and the results are reported for lateral tension and for partial contributions of intermolecular forces to it.Data for a widest possible range of areas per surfactant head, from tunnel formation through tensionless state, transition to floppy bilayer,to its disintegration, are reported and discussed. The significance of the tensionless state, is discussed. Conclusions: (1) the tensionless state is a coincidence;(2) the transition from extended to floppy bilayer occurs nearby and has hallmarks of a phase transition (3) there is no theory of that transition.(4)The lateral tension of the floppy bilayer scales with size; that of the extended bilayer does not depend on size. (4) The drumhead model not appropriate for interfaces as these fluctuate via diffusion.(5) The radius of gyration also! shows a discontinuity.

Search for the radiative leptonic decay B+ --> gamma l+ nu - We present the results of a search for $B^{+}\to\gamma \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}$, where $\ell = e, \mu$. We use a sample of 232 million $B\bar{B}$ pairs recorded at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $B$ Factory. We measure a partial branching fraction $\Delta\mathcal{B}$ in a restricted region of phase space that reduces the effect of theoretical uncertainties, requiring the lepton energy to be between 1.875 and 2.850GeV, the photon energy to be between 0.45 and 2.35GeV, and the cosine of the angle between the lepton and photon momenta to be less than -0.36, with all quantities computed in the $\Upsilon(4S)$ center-of-mass frame. We find $\Delta\mathcal{B}(B^{+}\to\gamma \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}) = (-0.3^{+1.3}_{-1.5} ({stat}) \pm 0.6 ({syst}) \pm 0.1 ({th})) \times 10^{-6}$, assuming lepton universality. Interpreted as a 90% C.L. Bayesian upper limit, the result corresponds to $1.7\times10^{-6}$ for a prior flat in amplitude, and $2.3\times10^{-6}$ for a prior flat in branching fraction.

Possible experimental manifestations of the many-body localization - Recently, it was predicted that if all one-electron states in a non-interacting disordered system are localized, the interaction between electrons in the absence of coupling to phonons leads to a finite-temperature metal-insulator trnasition. Here we show that even in the presence of a weak coupling to phonons the transition manifests itself (i) in the nonlinear conduction, leading to a bistable $I$-$V$ curve, (ii) by a dramatic enhancement of the nonequilibrium current noise near the transition.

Magnetic structure of Sm2IrIn8 - The magnetic structure of the intermetallic antiferromagnet Sm2IrIn8 was determined using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). Below TN = 14.2, Sm2IrIn8 has a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with a propagation vector (1/2,0,0). The Sm magnetic moments lie in the ab plane and are rotated roughly 18 degrees away from the a axis. The magnetic structure of this compound was obtained by measuring the strong dipolar resonant peak whose enhancement was of over two orders of magnitude at the L2 edge. At the L3 edge both quadrupolar and dipolar features were observed in the energy line shape. The magnetic structure and properties of Sm2IrIn8 are found to be consistent with the general trend already seen for the Nd-, Tb- and the Ce-based compounds from the RmMnIn3m+2n family (R = rare earth; M=Rh or Ir, m = 1, 2; n = 0, 1), where the crystalline electrical field (CEF) effects determine the direction of magnetic moments and the TN evolution in the series. The measured Neel temperature for Sm2IrIn8 is slightly suppressed when compared to the TN of the parent cubic compound SmIn3.

TEXES Observations of Pure Rotational H2 Emission From AB Aurigae - We present observations of pure rotational molecular hydrogen emission from the Herbig Ae star, AB Aurigae. Our observations were made using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Gemini North Observatory. We searched for H2 emission in the S(1), S(2), and S(4) lines at high spectral resolution and detected all three. By fitting a simple model for the emission in the three transitions, we derive T = 670 +/- 40 K and M = 0.52 +/- 0.15 earth masses for the emitting gas. Based on the 8.5 km/s FWHM of the S(2) line, assuming the emission comes from the circumstellar disk, and with an inclination estimate of the AB Aur system taken from the literature, we place the location for the emission near 18 AU. Comparison of our derived temperature to a disk structure model suggests that UV and X-ray heating are important in heating the disk atmosphere.

Deciphering top flavor violation at the LHC with B factories - The LHC will have unprecedented sensitivity to flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) top quark decays, whose observation would be a clear sign of physics beyond the standard model. Although many details of top flavor violation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top FCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We study these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy effective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the most important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current constraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level observable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first or second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for top decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. If FCNC top decays are observed at the LHC, such an analysis may help decipher the underlying physics.

Exploring Infrared Properties of Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies - Abridged: We present analysis of Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the three low surface brightness (LSB) optical giant galaxies Malin 1, UGC 6614 and UGC 9024. Mid- and far-infrared morphology, spectral energy distributions, and integrated colors are used to derive the dust mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio, total infrared luminosity, and star formation rate (SFR). The 8 micron images indicate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are present in the central regions of all three metal-poor LSB galaxies. The diffuse optical disks of Malin 1 and UGC 9024 remain undetected at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths. The dustiest of the three LSB galaxies, UGC 6614, has infrared morphology that varies significantly with wavelength. The 8 and 24 micron emission is co-spatial with H\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC 6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3} to 10^{-2}, support previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor compared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately 1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations are the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects. The SFR estimated from the infrared data ranges ~0.01-0.88 M_sun yr^{-1}, consistent with results from optical studies.

One-time pad booster for Internet - One-time pad encrypted files can be sent through Internet channels using current Internet protocols. However, the need for renewing shared secret keys make this method unpractical. This work shows how users can use a fast physical random generator based on fluctuations of a light field and the Internet channel to directly boost key renewals. The transmitted signals are deterministic but carries imprinted noise that cannot be eliminated by the attacker. Thus, a one-time pad for Internet can be made practical. Security is achieved without third parties and not relying on the difficulty of factoring numbers in primes. An informational fragility to be avoided is discussed. Information-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are determined.

A Local Concept of Wave Velocities - The classical characterization of \wp, as a typical concept for far field phenomena, has been successfully applied to many \w phenomena in past decades. The recent reports of superluminal tunnelling times and negative group velocities challenged this concept. A new local approach for the definition of \wvs avoiding these difficulties while including the classical definitions as particular cases is proposed here. This generalisation of the conventional non-local approach can be applied to arbitrary \w forms and propagation media. Some applications of the formalism are presented and basic properties of the concept are summarized.

Nodal/Antinodal Dichotomy and the Two Gaps of a Superconducting Doped Mott Insulator - We study the superconducting state of the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard model using Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory, with the Lanczos method as impurity solver. In the under-doped regime, we find a natural decomposition of the one-particle (photoemission) energy-gap into two components. The gap in the nodal regions, stemming from the anomalous self-energy, decreases with decreasing doping. The antinodal gap has an additional contribution from the normal component of the self-energy, inherited from the normal-state pseudogap, and it increases as the Mott insulating phase is approached.

Wavelet frames, Bergman spaces and Fourier transforms of Laguerre functions - The Fourier transforms of Laguerre functions play the same canonical role in wavelet analysis as do the Hermite functions in Gabor analysis. We will use them as analyzing wavelets in a similar way the Hermite functions were recently by K. Groechenig and Y. Lyubarskii in "Gabor frames with Hermite functions, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 344 157-162 (2007)". Building on the work of K. Seip, "Beurling type density theorems in the unit disc, Invent. Math., 113, 21-39 (1993)", concerning sampling sequences on weighted Bergman spaces, we find a sufficient density condition for constructing frames by translations and dilations of the Fourier transform of the nth Laguerre function. As in Groechenig-Lyubarskii theorem, the density increases with n, and in the special case of the hyperbolic lattice in the upper half plane it is given by b\log a<\frac{4\pi}{2n+\alpha}, where alpha is the parameter of the Laguerre function.

On Beltrami fields with nonconstant proportionality factor on the plane - We consider the equation rotB+aB=0 (1) in the plane with a being a real-valued function and show that it can be reduced to a Vekua equation of a special form. In the case when a depends on one Cartesian variable a complete system of exact solutions of the Vekua equation and hence of equation (1) is constructed based on L. Bers' theory of formal powers.

Where the monotone pattern (mostly) rules - We consider pattern containment and avoidance with a very tight definition that was used first by Riordan more than 60 years ago. Using this definition, we prove the monotone pattern is easier to avoid than almost any other pattern of the same length. We also show that with this definition, almost all patterns of length $k$ are avoided by the same number of permutations of length $n$. The corresponding statements are not known to be true for more relaxed definitions of pattern containment. This is the first time we know of that expectations are used to compare numbers of permutations avoiding certain patterns.

Staggered Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory - Although taste violations significantly affect the results of staggered calculations of pseudoscalar and heavy-light mesonic quantities, those entering staggered calculations of baryonic quantities have not been quantified. Here I develop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector by mapping the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. For 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are calculated to third order in partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered chiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading chiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as well as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with virtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators in loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The pattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings are discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice results obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the restoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit. I assume that the fourth root of the fermion determinant can be incorporated in staggered chiral perturbation theory using the replica method.

Imaging Magnetic Focusing of Coherent Electron Waves - The magnetic focusing of electrons has proven its utility in fundamental studies of electron transport. Here we report the direct imaging of magnetic focusing of electron waves, specifically in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). We see the semicircular trajectories of electrons as they bounce along a boundary in the 2DEG, as well as fringes showing the coherent nature of the electron waves. Imaging flow in open systems is made possible by a cooled scanning probe microscope. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory demonstrates our ability to see these trajectories and to use this system as an interferometer. We image branched electron flow as well as the interference of electron waves. This technique can visualize the motion of electron waves between two points in an open system, providing a straightforward way to study systems that may be useful for quantum information processing and spintronics.

On the solution of the static Maxwell system in axially symmetric inhomogeneous media - We consider the static Maxwell system with an axially symmetric dielectric permittivity and construct complete systems of its solutions which can be used for analytic and numerical solution of corresponding boundary value problems.

On a {K_4,K_{2,2,2}}-ultrahomogeneous graph - The existence of a connected 12-regular $\{K_4,K_{2,2,2}\}$-ultrahomogeneous graph $G$ is established, (i.e. each isomorphism between two copies of $K_4$ or $K_{2,2,2}$ in $G$ extends to an automorphism of $G$), with the 42 ordered lines of the Fano plane taken as vertices. This graph $G$ can be expressed in a unique way both as the edge-disjoint union of 42 induced copies of $K_4$ and as the edge-disjoint union of 21 induced copies of $K_{2,2,2}$, with no more copies of $K_4$ or $K_{2,2,2}$ existing in $G$. Moreover, each edge of $G$ is shared by exactly one copy of $K_4$ and one of $K_{2,2,2}$. While the line graphs of $d$-cubes, ($3\le d\in\ZZ$), are $\{K_d, K_{2,2}\}$-ultrahomogeneous, $G$ is not even line-graphical. In addition, the chordless 6-cycles of $G$ are seen to play an interesting role and some self-dual configurations associated to $G$ with 2-arc-transitive, arc-transitive and semisymmetric Levi graphs are considered.

Unconventional approaches to combine optical transparency with electrical conductivity - Combination of electrical conductivity and optical transparency in the same material -- known to be a prerogative of only a few oxides of post-transition metals, such as In, Sn, Zn and Cd -- manifests itself in a distinctive band structure of the transparent conductor host. While the oxides of other elements with $s^2$ electronic configuration, for example, Mg, Ca, Sc and Al, also exhibit the desired optical and electronic features, they have not been considered as candidates for achieving good electrical conductivity because of the challenges of efficient carrier generation in these wide-bandgap materials. Here we demonstrate that alternative approaches to the problem not only allow attaining the transport and optical properties which compete with those in currently utilized transparent conducting oxides (TCO), but also significantly broaden the range of materials with a potential of being developed into novel functional transparent conductors.

Exponential Decay of Correlations for Randomly Chosen Hyperbolic Toral Automorphisms - We consider pairs of toral automorphisms (A,B) satisfying an invariant cone property. At each iteration, A acts with probability p and B with probability 1-p. We prove exponential decay of correlations for a class of Holder continuous observables.

Follow-up observations of pulsating subdwarf B stars: Multisite campaigns on PG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091 - We present follow-up observations of pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) stars as part of our efforts to resolve the pulsation spectra for use in asteroseismological analyses. This paper reports on multisite campaigns of the pulsating sdB stars PG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091. Data were obtained from observatories placed around the globe for coverage from all longitudes. For PG 1618+563B, our five-site campaign uncovered a dichotomy of pulsation states: Early during the campaign the amplitudes and phases (and perhaps frequencies) were quite variable while data obtained late in the campaign were able to fully resolve five stable pulsation frequencies. For PG 0048+091, our five-site campaign uncovered a plethora of frequencies with short pulsation lifetimes. We find them to have observed properties consistent with stochastically excited oscillations, an unexpected result for subdwarf B stars. We discuss our findings and their impact on subdwarf B asteroseismology.

Connecting microscopic simulations with kinetically constrained models of glasses - Kinetically constrained spin models are known to exhibit dynamical behavior mimicking that of glass forming systems. They are often understood as coarse-grained models of glass formers, in terms of some "mobility" field. The identity of this "mobility" field has remained elusive due to the lack of coarse-graining procedures to obtain these models from a more microscopic point of view. Here we exhibit a scheme to map the dynamics of a two-dimensional soft disc glass former onto a kinetically constrained spin model, providing an attempt at bridging these two approaches.

DIRBE Minus 2MASS: Confirming the CIRB in 40 New Regions at 2.2 and 3.5 Microns - With the release of the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalog, stellar fluxes from 2MASS are used to remove the contribution due to Galactic stars from the intensity measured by DIRBE in 40 new regions in the North and South Galactic polar caps. After subtracting the interplanetary and Galactic foregrounds, a consistent residual intensity of 14.69 +/- 4.49 kJy/sr at 2.2 microns is found. Allowing for a constant calibration factor between the DIRBE 3.5 microns and the 2MASS 2.2 microns fluxes, a similar analysis leaves a residual intensity of 15.62 +/- 3.34 kJy/sr at 3.5 microns. The intercepts of the DIRBE minus 2MASS correlation at 1.25 microns show more scatter and are a smaller fraction of the foreground, leading to a still weak limit on the CIRB of 8.88 +/- 6.26 kJy/sr (1 sigma).

Averaging of the electron effective mass in multicomponent transparent conducting oxides - We find that layered materials composed of various oxides of cations with $s^2$ electronic configuration, $XY_2$O$_4$, $X$=In or Sc, $Y$=Ga, Zn, Al, Cd and/or Mg, exhibit isotropic electron effective mass which can be obtained via averaging over those of the corresponding single-cation oxide constituents. This effect is due to a hybrid nature of the conduction band formed from the s-states of {\it all} cations and the oxygen p-states. Moreover, the observed insensitivity of the electron effective mass to the oxygen coordination and to the distortions in the cation-oxygen chains suggests that similar behavior can be expected in technologically important amorphous state. These findings significantly broaden the range of materials as efficient transparent conductor hosts.

A Search for Electron Neutrino Appearance at the Delta m**2 ~ 1 eV**2 Scale - The MiniBooNE Collaboration reports first results of a search for $\nu_e$ appearance in a $\nu_\mu$ beam. With two largely independent analyses, we observe no significant excess of events above background for reconstructed neutrino energies above 475 MeV. The data are consistent with no oscillations within a two neutrino appearance-only oscillation model.

Surface Structure Analysis of Atomically Smooth BaBiO$_3$ Films - Using low energy Time-of-Flight Scattering and Recoil Spectroscopy (TOF-SARS) and Mass Spectroscopy of Recoiled Ions (MSRI) we analyze the surface structure of an atomically smooth BaBiO$_3$ film grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We demonstrate high sensitivity of the TOF-SARS and MSRI spectra to slight changes in the orientation of the ion scattering plane with respect to the crystallographic axes. The observed angle dependence allows us to clearly identify the termination layer as BiO$_2$. Our data also indicate that angle-resolved MSRI data can be used for high resolution studies of surface structure of complex oxide thin films.

Evolution of Magnetic Fields in Stars Across the Upper Main Sequence: II. Observed distribution of the magnetic field geometry - We re-discuss the evolutionary state of upper main sequence magnetic stars using a sample of Ap and Bp stars with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and definitely determined longitudinal magnetic fields. We confirm our previous results obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that magnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the main-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be concentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby open clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions. Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive stars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found for any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic flux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An excess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and lower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the distribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become observable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main sequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg or 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be somewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for an increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M > 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun. However, the predominance of high values of beta at advanced ages in these stars is notable.

A Diagrammatic Category for the Representation Theory of U_q(sl_n) - This thesis provides a partial answer to a question posed by Greg Kuperberg in q-alg/9712003 and again by Justin Roberts as problem 12.18 in "Problems on invariants of knots and 3-manifolds", math.GT/0406190, essentially: "Can one describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n) (thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?" For each n \geq 0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs, modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n). One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n). I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403. The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1}) in U_q(sl_n}. We know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1. This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.

The Formation of Lake Stars - Star patterns, reminiscent of a wide range of diffusively controlled growth forms from snowflakes to Saffman-Taylor fingers, are ubiquitous features of ice covered lakes. Despite the commonality and beauty of these ``lake stars'' the underlying physical processes that produce them have not been explained in a coherent theoretical framework. Here we describe a simple mathematical model that captures the principal features of lake-star formation; radial fingers of (relatively warm) water-rich regions grow from a central source and evolve through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a stability analysis of this competition and the qualitative features of this meter-scale natural phenomena are captured in laboratory experiments.

A Higgs-Higgs bound state due to New Physics at a TeV - We examine the effects of new physics effecting the Higgs sector of the standard model, focusing on the effects on the Higgs self couplings. We demonstrate that a low mass higgs, m_h < 2 m_t, can have a strong effective self coupling due to the effects of a new interaction at a TeV. We investigate the possibility that the first evidence of such an interaction could be a higgs-higgs bound state. To this end, we construct an effective field theory formalism to examine the physics of such a low mass higgs boson. We explore the possibility of a non relativistic bound state of the higgs field (Higgsium) at LHC and construct a non relativistic effective field theory of the higgs sector that is appropriate for such studies (NRHET).

Measuring two-photon orbital angular momentum entanglement - We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.

HST/ACS Coronagraphic Observations of the Dust Surrounding HD 100546 - We present ACS/HST coronagraphic observations of HD 100546, a B9.5 star, 103 pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta (F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed disk material.

Anomalous diffusion and stretched exponentials in heterogeneous glass-forming liquids: Low-temperature behavior - We propose a model of a heterogeneous glass forming liquid and compute the low-temperature behavior of a tagged molecule moving within it. This model exhibits stretched-exponential decay of the wavenumber-dependent, self intermediate scattering function in the limit of long times. At temperatures close to the glass transition, where the heterogeneities are much larger in extent than the molecular spacing, the time dependence of the scattering function crosses over from stretched-exponential decay with an index $b=1/2$ at large wave numbers to normal, diffusive behavior with $b = 1$ at small wavenumbers. There is a clear separation between early-stage, cage-breaking $\beta$ relaxation and late-stage $\alpha$ relaxation. The spatial representation of the scattering function exhibits an anomalously broad exponential (non-Gaussian) tail for sufficiently large values of the molecular displacement at all finite times.

Modeling the Solar Chromosphere - Spectral diagnostic features formed in the solar chromosphere are few and difficult to interpret -- they are neither formed in the optically thin regime nor in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). To probe the state of the chromosphere, both from observations and theory, it is therefore necessary with modeling. I discuss both traditional semi-empirical modeling, numerical experiments illustrating important ingredients necessary for a self-consistent theoretical modeling of the solar chromosphere and the first results of such models.

A compact star rotating at 1122 Hz and the r-mode instability - We show that r-mode instabilities severely constraint the composition of a compact star rotating at a submillisecond period. In particular, the only viable astrophysical scenario for such an object, present inside the Low Mass X-ray Binary associated with the x-ray transient XTE J1739-285, is that it has a strangeness content. Since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or stars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates, the only remaining possibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid quark-hadron star. We also discuss under which conditions sub-millisecond pulsars are rare.

3d Numerical Models of the Chromosphere, Transition Region, and Corona - A major goal in solar physics has during the last five decades been to find how energy flux generated in the solar convection zone is transported and dissipated in the outer solar layers. Progress in this field has been slow and painstaking. However, advances in computer hardware and numerical methods, vastly increased observational capabilities and growing physical insight seem finally to be leading towards understanding. Here we present exploratory numerical MHD models that span the entire solar atmosphere from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. These models include non-grey, non-LTE radiative transport in the photosphere and chromosphere, optically thin radiative losses as well as magnetic field-aligned heat conduction in the transition region and corona.

Gauge Invariant Factorisation and Canonical Quantisation of Topologically Massive Gauge Theories in Any Dimension - Abelian topologically massive gauge theories (TMGT) provide a topological mechanism to generate mass for a bosonic p-tensor field in any spacetime dimension. These theories include the 2+1 dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons and 3+1 dimensional Cremmer-Scherk actions as particular cases. Within the Hamiltonian formulation, the embedded topological field theory (TFT) sector related to the topological mass term is not manifest in the original phase space. However through an appropriate canonical transformation, a gauge invariant factorisation of phase space into two orthogonal sectors is feasible. The first of these sectors includes canonically conjugate gauge invariant variables with free massive excitations. The second sector, which decouples from the total Hamiltonian, is equivalent to the phase space description of the associated non dynamical pure TFT. Within canonical quantisation, a likewise factorisation of quantum states thus arises for the full spectrum of TMGT in any dimension. This new factorisation scheme also enables a definition of the usual projection from TMGT onto topological quantum field theories in a most natural and transparent way. None of these results rely on any gauge fixing procedure whatsoever.

Compensation of loss in propagating surface plasmon polariton by gain in adjacent dielectric medium - We report the suppression of loss of surface plasmon polariton propagating at the interface between silver film and optically pumped polymer with dye. Large magnitude of the effect enables a variety of applications of "active" nanoplasmonics. The experimental study is accompanied by the development of the analytical description of the phenomenon and the solution of the controversy regarding the direction of the wavevector of a wave with a strong evanescent component in an active medium.

Towards Functional Flows for Hierarchical Models - The recursion relations of hierarchical models are studied and contrasted with functional renormalisation group equations in corresponding approximations. The formalisms are compared quantitatively for the Ising universality class, where the spectrum of universal eigenvalues at criticality is studied. A significant correlation amongst scaling exponents is pointed out and analysed in view of an underlying optimisation. Functional flows are provided which match with high accuracy all known scaling exponents from Dyson's hierarchical model for discrete block-spin transformations. Implications of the results are discussed.

High Precision CTE-Measurement of SiC-100 for Cryogenic Space-Telescopes - We present the results of high precision measurements of the thermal expansion of the sintered SiC, SiC-100, intended for use in cryogenic space-telescopes, in which minimization of thermal deformation of the mirror is critical and precise information of the thermal expansion is needed for the telescope design. The temperature range of the measurements extends from room temperature down to $\sim$ 10 K. Three samples, #1, #2, and #3 were manufactured from blocks of SiC produced in different lots. The thermal expansion of the samples was measured with a cryogenic dilatometer, consisting of a laser interferometer, a cryostat, and a mechanical cooler. The typical thermal expansion curve is presented using the 8th order polynomial of the temperature. For the three samples, the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), $\bar{\alpha}_{#1}$, $\bar{\alpha}_{#2}$, and $\bar{\alpha}_{#3}$ were derived for temperatures between 293 K and 10 K. The average and the dispersion (1 $\sigma$ rms) of these three CTEs are 0.816 and 0.002 ($\times 10^{-6}$/K), respectively. No significant difference was detected in the CTE of the three samples from the different lots. Neither inhomogeneity nor anisotropy of the CTE was observed. Based on the obtained CTE dispersion, we performed an finite-element-method (FEM) analysis of the thermal deformation of a 3.5 m diameter cryogenic mirror made of six SiC-100 segments. It was shown that the present CTE measurement has a sufficient accuracy well enough for the design of the 3.5 m cryogenic infrared telescope mission, the Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA).

Compton Scattering of Fe K alpha Lines in Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables - Compton scattering of X-rays in the bulk flow of the accretion column in magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) can significantly shift photon energies. We present Monte Carlo simulations based on a nonlinear algorithm demonstrating the effects of Compton scattering on the H-like, He-like and neutral Fe K alpha lines produced in the post-shock region of the accretion column. The peak line emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included. We find that line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have also explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a realistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant overall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated line spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per indicates that a wing feature redward of the 6.4 keV line may result from Compton recoil near the base of the accretion column.

The Limits of Special Relativity - The Special Theory of Relativity and the Theory of the Electron have had an interesting history together. Originally the electron was studied in a non relativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead to the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the application of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an extended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary to popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the context of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out the interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton scale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary to an uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.

Crystalline silicates and dust processing in the protoplanetary disks of the Taurus young cluster - We characterize the crystalline silicate content and spatial distribution of small dust grains in a large sample of protoplanetary disks in the Taurus-Auriga young cluster, using Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared spectra. In turn we use the results to analyze the evolution of structure and composition of these 1-2 Myr-old disks around Solar- and later-type young stars, and test the standard models of dust processing which result in the conversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. We find strong evidence of evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of the structure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fraction is strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. We also confirm that the crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r < 10 AU. However, we see no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar mass or luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, as would be expected in the standard models of dust processing based upon photo-evaporation and condensation close to the central star, accretion-heating-driven annealing at r < 1 AU, or spiral-shock heating at r < 10 AU, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. Either another grain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must be at work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. We propose one of each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely X-ray heating and annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure by giant-planetary formation and migration.

Comprehensive simulations of superhumps - (Abridged) We use 3D SPH calculations with higher resolution, as well as with more realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to examine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in semi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We compare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the disc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops, the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08. We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show that the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.

Singular Energy Distributions in Granular Media - We study the kinetic theory of driven granular gases, taking into account both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. We obtain the high-energy tail of the stationary bivariate energy distribution, depending on the total energy E and the ratio x=sqrt{E_w/E} of rotational energy E_w to total energy. Extremely energetic particles have a unique and well-defined distribution f(x) which has several remarkable features: x is not uniformly distributed as in molecular gases; f(x) is not smooth but has multiple singularities. The latter behavior is sensitive to material properties such as the collision parameters, the moment of inertia and the collision rate. Interestingly, there are preferred ratios of rotational-to-total energy. In general, f(x) is strongly correlated with energy and the deviations from a uniform distribution grow with energy. We also solve for the energy distribution of freely cooling Maxwell Molecules and find qualitatively similar behavior.

Cosmological Shock Waves in the Large Scale Structure of the Universe: Non-gravitational Effects - Cosmological shock waves result from supersonic flow motions induced by hierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe. These shocks govern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles. We study the statistics and energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance $\Lambda$CDM universe, with a special emphasis on the effects of non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating, and galactic superwind feedbacks. Adopting an improved model for gas thermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and the CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in cosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks are governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational processes do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and vorticity generation at cosmological shocks. Our results reinforce scenarios in which the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium contain energetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulent flow motions.

Outstanding Issues in Our Understanding of L, T, and Y Dwarfs - Since the discovery of the first L dwarf 19 years ago and the discovery of the first T dwarf 7 years after that, we have amassed a large list of these objects, now numbering almost six hundred. Despite making headway in understanding the physical chemistry of their atmospheres, some important issues remain unexplained. Three of these are the subject of this paper: (1) What is the role of "second parameters" such as gravity and metallicity in shaping the emergent spectra of L and T dwarfs? Can we establish a robust classification scheme so that objects with unusual values of log(g) or [M/H], unusual dust content, or unresolved binarity are easily recognized? (2) Which physical processes drive the unusual behavior at the L/T transition? Which observations can be obtained to better confine the problem? (3) What will objects cooler than T8 look like? How will we know a Y dwarf when we first observe one?

The orbit, mass, size, albedo, and density of (65489) Ceto/Phorcys: A tidally-evolved binary Centaur - Hubble Space Telescope observations of Uranus- and Neptune-crossing object (65489) Ceto/Phorcys (provisionally designated 2003 FX128) reveal it to be a close binary system. The mutual orbit has a period of 9.554 +/- 0.011 days and a semimajor axis of 1840 +/- 48 km. These values enable computation of a system mass of (5.41 +/- 0.42) 10^18 kg. Spitzer Space Telescope observations of thermal emission at 24 and 70 microns are combined with visible photometry to constrain the system's effective radius (109 +10/-11 km) and geometric albedo (0.084 +0.021/-0.014). We estimate the average bulk density to be 1.37 +0.66/-0.32 g cm^-3, consistent with ice plus rocky and/or carbonaceous materials. This density contrasts with lower densities recently measured with the same technique for three other comparably-sized outer Solar System binaries (617) Patroclus, (26308) 1998 SM165, and (47171) 1999 TC36, and is closer to the density of the saturnian irregular satellite Phoebe. The mutual orbit of Ceto and Phorcys is nearly circular, with an eccentricity <= 0.015. This observation is consistent with calculations suggesting that the system should tidally evolve on a timescale shorter than the age of the solar system.

GLRT-Optimal Noncoherent Lattice Decoding - This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation. We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission (PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.

Distributions of H2O and CO2 ices on Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon from IRTF/SpeX observations - We present 0.8 to 2.4 micron spectral observations of uranian satellites, obtained at IRTF/SpeX on 17 nights during 2001-2005. The spectra reveal for the first time the presence of CO2 ice on the surfaces of Umbriel and Titania, by means of 3 narrow absorption bands near 2 microns. Several additional, weaker CO2 ice absorptions have also been detected. No CO2 absorption is seen in Oberon spectra, and the strengths of the CO2 ice bands decline with planetocentric distance from Ariel through Titania. We use the CO2 absorptions to map the longitudinal distribution of CO2 ice on Ariel, Umbriel, and Titania, showing that it is most abundant on their trailing hemispheres. We also examine H2O ice absorptions in the spectra, finding deeper H2O bands on the leading hemispheres of Ariel, Umbriel, and Titania, but the opposite pattern on Oberon. Potential mechanisms to produce the observed longitudinal and planetocentric distributions of the two ices are considered.

Proof of the Labastida-Marino-Ooguri-Vafa Conjecture - Based on large N Chern-Simons/topological string duality, in a series of papers, J.M.F. Labastida, M. Marino, H. Ooguri and C. Vafa conjectured certain remarkable new algebraic structure of link invariants and the existence of infinite series of new integer invariants. In this paper, we provide a proof of this conjecture. Moreover, we also show these new integer invariants vanish at large genera.

Study of exotic hadrons in s-wave chiral dynamics - We study the exotic hadrons in s-wave scattering of the Nambu-Goldstone boson with a target hadron based on chiral dynamics. Utilizing the low energy theorem of chiral symmetry, we show that the s-wave interaction is not strong enough to generate bound states in exotic channels in flavor SU(3) symmetric limit, although the interaction is responsible for generating some nonexotic hadron resonances dynamically. We discuss the renormalization condition adopted in this analysis.

Extremely strong-coupling superconductivity and anomalous lattice properties in the beta-pyrochlore oxide KOs2O6 - Superconducting and normal-state properties of the beta-pyrochlore oxide KOs2O6 are studied by means of thermodynamic and transport measurements. It is shown that the superconductivity is of conventional s-wave type and lies in the extremely strong-coupling regime. Specific heat and resistivity measurements reveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to unusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The entity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion confined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra. It is suggested that this electron-rattler coupling mediates the Cooper pairing, resulting in the extremely strong-coupling superconductivity.

Analysis of low energy pion spectra - The transverse mass spectra and the rapidity distributions of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ in Au-Au collisions at 2, 4, 6, and 8 GeV$\cdot$A by E895 collaboration are fitted using an elliptically expanding fireball model with the contribution from the resonance decays and the final state Coulomb interaction. The ratio of the total number of produced $\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$ is used to fit the data. The resulting freeze-out temperature is rather low($T_f < 60$ MeV) with large transverse flow and thus resonance contribution is very small. The difference in the shape of $m_t$ spectra of the oppositely charged pions are found to be due to the Coulomb interaction of the pions.

A study of the $p d \to p d \eta$ reaction - A study of the $p d \to p d \eta$ reaction in the energy range where the recent data from Uppsala are available, is done in the two-step model of $\eta$ production including the final state interaction. The $\eta -d$ final state interaction is incorporated through the solution of the Lippmann Schwinger equation using an elastic scattering matrix element, $T_{\eta d \to \eta d}$, which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form, with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev equation solution for the $\eta NN$ system corresponding to different $\eta-N$ scattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few body equations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate $T_{\eta d \to \eta d}$. The $p-d$ final state interaction is included in the spirit of the Watson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of the Jost function. The $\eta-d$ interaction is found to be dominant in the region of small invariant $\eta -d$ mass, $M_{\eta d}$. The $p-d$ interaction enhances the cross section in the whole region of $M_{\eta d}$, but is larger for large $M_{\eta d}$. We find nearly isotropic angular distributions of the proton and the deuteron in the final state. All the above observations are in agreement with data. The production mechanism for the entire range of the existing data on the $p d \to p d \eta$ reaction seems to be dominated by the two-step model of $\eta$ production.

On the exact formula for neutrino oscillation probability by Kimura, Takamura and Yokomakura - The exact formula for the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with constant density, which was discovered by Kimura, Takamura and Yokomakura, has been applied mostly to the standard case with three flavor neutrino so far. In this paper applications of their formula to more general cases are discussed. It is shown that this formalism can be generalized to various cases where the matter potential have off-diagonal components, and the two non-trivial examples are given: the case with magnetic moments and a magnetic field and the case with non-standard interactions. It is pointed out that their formalism can be applied also to the case in the long baseline limit with matter whose density varies adiabatically as in the case of solar neutrino.

Absolute measurement of the nitrogen fluorescence yield in air between 300 and 430 nm - The nitrogen fluorescence induced in air is used to detect ultra-high energy cosmic rays and to measure their energy. The precise knowledge of the absolute fluorescence yield is the key quantity to improve the accuracy on the cosmic ray energy. The total yield has been measured in dry air using a 90Sr source and a [300-430 nm] filter. The fluorescence yield in air is 4.23 $\pm$ 0.20 photons per meter when normalized to 760 mmHg, 15 degrees C and with an electron energy of 0.85 MeV. This result is consistent with previous experiments made at various energies, but with an accuracy improved by a factor of about 3. For the first time, the absolute continuous spectrum of nitrogen excited by 90Sr electrons has also been measured with a spectrometer. Details of this experiment are given in one of the author's PhD thesis [32].

Concrete Classification and Centralizers of Certain $\mathbb{Z}^2 \rtimes {\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-actions - We introduce a new class of actions of the group $\G$ on finite von Neumann algebras and call them twisted Bernoulli shift actions. We classify these actions up to conjugacy and give an explicit description of their centralizers. We also distinguish many of those actions on the AFD $\mathrm{II}_1$ factor in view of outer conjugacy.

The Phase-resolved High Energy Spectrum of the Crab Pulsar - We present a modified outer gap model to study the phase-resolved spectra of the Crab pulsar. A theoretical double peak profile of the light curve containing the whole phase is shown to be consistent with the observed light curve of the Crab pulsar by shifting the inner boundary of the outer gap inwardly to $\sim 10$ stellar radii above the neutron star surface. In this model, the radial distances of the photons corresponding to different phases can be determined in the numerical calculation. Also the local electrodynamics, such as the accelerating electric field, the curvature radius of the magnetic field line and the soft photon energy, are sensitive to the radial distances to the neutron star. Using a synchrotron self-Compton mechanism, the phase-resolved spectra with the energy range from 100 eV to 3 GeV of the Crab pulsar can also be explained.

Massive N=1 supermultiplets with arbitrary superspins - In this paper we give explicit construction of massive N=1 supermultiplets in flat d=4 Minkowski space-time. We work in a component on-shell formalism based on gauge invariant description of massive integer and half-integer spin particles where massive supermultiplets are constructed out of appropriate set of massless ones.

Critical Current of Type-II Superconductors in a Broken Bose Glass State - The tilt modulus of a defective Abrikosov vortex lattice pinned by material line defects is computed using the boson analogy. It tends to infinity at long wavelength, which yields a Bose glass state that is robust to the addition of weak point-pinning centers, and which implies a restoring force per vortex line for rigid translations about mechanical equilibrium that is independent of magnetic field. It also indicates that the Bose glass state breaks into pieces along the direction of the correlated pinning centers if the latter have finite length. The critical current is predicted to crossover from two dimensional to three dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the correlated pinning centers in such case. That crossover notably can occur at a film thickness that is much larger than that expected from point pins of comparable strength. The above is compared to the dependence on thickness shown by the critical current in certain films of high-temperature superconductors currently being developed for wire technology.

Estimates for singular integrals and extrapolation - We prove a sharp Lp estimate for a singular Radon transform according to a size condition of its kernel, which is useful for extrapolation.

Rounding of first-order phase transitions and optimal cooperation in scale-free networks - We consider the ferromagnetic large-$q$ state Potts model in complex evolving networks, which is equivalent to an optimal cooperation problem, in which the agents try to optimize the total sum of pair cooperation benefits and the supports of independent projects. The agents are found to be typically of two kinds: a fraction of $m$ (being the magnetization of the Potts model) belongs to a large cooperating cluster, whereas the others are isolated one man's projects. It is shown rigorously that the homogeneous model has a strongly first-order phase transition, which turns to second-order for random interactions (benefits), the properties of which are studied numerically on the Barab\'asi-Albert network. The distribution of finite-size transition points is characterized by a shift exponent, $1/\tilde{\nu}'=.26(1)$, and by a different width exponent, $1/\nu'=.18(1)$, whereas the magnetization at the transition point scales with the size of the network, $N$, as: $m\sim N^{-x}$, with $x=.66(1)$.

A New Monte Carlo Method and Its Implications for Generalized Cluster Algorithms - We describe a novel switching algorithm based on a ``reverse'' Monte Carlo method, in which the potential is stochastically modified before the system configuration is moved. This new algorithm facilitates a generalized formulation of cluster-type Monte Carlo methods, and the generalization makes it possible to derive cluster algorithms for systems with both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom. The roughening transition in the sine-Gordon model has been studied with this method, and high-accuracy simulations for system sizes up to $1024^2$ were carried out to examine the logarithmic divergence of the surface roughness above the transition temperature, revealing clear evidence for universal scaling of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type.

The Orbifolds of Permutation-Type as Physical String Systems at Multiples of $c=26$ III. The Spectra of $\hat{c}=52$ Strings - In the second paper of this series, I obtained the twisted BRST systems and extended physical-state conditions of all twisted open and closed $\hat{c} = 52$ strings. In this paper, I supplement the extended physical-state conditions with the explicit form of the extended (twisted) Virasoro generators of all $\hat{c} = 52$ strings, which allows us to discuss the physical spectra of these systems. Surprisingly, all the $\hat{c}=52$ spectra admit an equivalent description in terms of generically-unconventional Virasoro generators at $c=26$. This description strongly supports our prior conjecture that the $\hat{c}=52$ strings are free of negative-norm states, and moreover shows that the spectra of some of the simpler cases are equivalent to those of ordinary untwisted open and closed $c=26$ strings.

Riemannian and Lorentzian structures on the non symmetric space SO(2m)/Sp(m) - In this work, we are interested in a non symmetric homogeneous space, namely $SO(2m)/Sp(m)$. We show that this space admits a structure of $Z_2^2$-symmetric space. We describe all the non degenerated metrics and classify the Riemannian and Lorentzian ones.

Quasiparticles in Neon using the Faddeev Random Phase Approximation - The spectral function of the closed-shell Neon atom is computed by expanding the electron self-energy through a set of Faddeev equations. This method describes the coupling of single-particle degrees of freedom with correlated two-electron, two-hole, and electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectra are obtained using the Random Phase Approximation, rather than the Tamm-Dancoff framework employed in the third-order algebraic diagrammatic contruction [ADC(3)] method. The difference between these two approaches is studied, as well as the interplay between ladder and ring diagrams in the self-energy. Satisfactory results are obtained for the ionization energies as well as the energy of the ground state with the Faddeev-RPA scheme that is also appropriate for the high-density electron gas.

Discrete Nonholonomic Lagrangian Systems on Lie Groupoids - This paper studies the construction of geometric integrators for nonholonomic systems. We derive the nonholonomic discrete Euler-Lagrange equations in a setting which permits to deduce geometric integrators for continuous nonholonomic systems (reduced or not). The formalism is given in terms of Lie groupoids, specifying a discrete Lagrangian and a constraint submanifold on it. Additionally, it is necessary to fix a vector subbundle of the Lie algebroid associated to the Lie groupoid. We also discuss the existence of nonholonomic evolution operators in terms of the discrete nonholonomic Legendre transformations and in terms of adequate decompositions of the prolongation of the Lie groupoid. The characterization of the reversibility of the evolution operator and the discrete nonholonomic momentum equation are also considered. Finally, we illustrate with several classical examples the wide range of application of the theory (the discrete nonholonomic constrained particle, the Suslov system, the Chaplygin sleigh, the Veselova system, the rolling ball on a rotating table and the two wheeled planar mobile robot).

Pseudogap and charge density waves in two dimensions - An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap. Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed, experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.

Supersymmetric Field Theory Based on Generalized Uncertainty Principle - We construct a quantum theory of free fermion field based on the generalized uncertainty principle using supersymmetry as a guiding principle. A supersymmetric field theory with a real scalar field and a Majorana fermion field is given explicitly and we also find that the supersymmetry algebra is deformed from an usual one.

Optimal flexibility for conformational transitions in macromolecules - Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable, e.g. at a localized "hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of "cargo'' attached to the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.

AFM Imaging of SWI/SNF action: mapping the nucleosome remodeling and sliding - We propose a combined experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical study of the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts. First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed between conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative changes in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then, the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to previous studies.

When the orbit algebra of group is an integral domain? Proof of a conjecture of P.J. Cameron - P.J.Cameron introduced the orbit algebra of a permutation group and conjectured that this algebra is an integral domain if and only if the group has no finite orbit. We prove that this conjecture holds and in fact that the age algebra of a relational structure $R$ is an integral domain if and only if $R$ is age-inexhaustible. We deduce these results from a combinatorial lemma asserting that if a product of two non-zero elements of a set algebra is zero then there is a finite common tranversal of their supports. The proof is built on Ramsey theorem and the integrity of a shuffle algebra.

Saturated actions by finite dimensional Hopf *-algebras on C*-algebras - If a finite group action $\alpha$ on a unital $C^*$-algebra $M$ is saturated, the canonical conditional expectation $E:M\to M^\alpha$ onto the fixed point algebra is known to be of index finite type with $Index(E)=|G|$ in the sense of Watatani. More generally if a finite dimensional Hopf $*$-algebra $A$ acts on $M$ and the action is saturated, the same is true with $Index (E)=\dim(A)$. In this paper we prove that the converse is true. Especially in case $M$ is a commutative $C^*$-algebra $C(X)$ and $\alpha$ is a finite group action, we give an equivalent condition in order that the expectation $E:C(X)\to C(X)^\alpha$ is of index finite type, from which we obtain that $\alpha$ is saturated if and only if $G$ acts freely on $X$. Actions by compact groups are also considered to show that the gauge action $\gamma$ on a graph $C^*$-algebra $C^*(E)$ associated with a locally finite directed graph $E$ is saturated.

The electronic structures, the equilibrium geometries and finite temperature properties of Na_n (n=39-55) - Density-functional theory has been applied to investigate systematics of sodium clusters Na_n in the size range of n= 39-55. A clear evolutionary trend in the growth of their ground-state geometries emerges. The clusters at the beginning of the series (n=39-43) are symmetric and have partial icosahedral (two-shell) structure. The growth then goes through a series of disordered clusters (n=44-52) where the icosahedral core is lost. However, for n>52 a three shell icosahedral structure emerges. This change in the nature of the geometry is abrupt. In addition, density-functional molecular dynamics has been used to calculate the specific heat curves for the representative sizes n= 43, 45, 48 and 52. These results along with already available thermodynamic calculations for n= 40, 50, and 55 enable us to carry out a detailed comparison of the heat capacity curves with their respective geometries for the entire series. Our results clearly bring out strong correlation between the evolution of the geometries and the nature of the shape of the heat capacities. The results also firmly establish the size-sensitive nature of the heat capacities in sodium clusters.

Quantum Zeno Effect in the Decoherent Histories - The quantum Zeno effect arises due to frequent observation. That implies the existence of some experimenter and its interaction with the system. In this contribution, we examine what happens for a closed system if one considers a quantum Zeno type of question, namely: "what is the probability of a system, remaining always in a particular subspace". This has implications to the arrival time problem that is also discussed. We employ the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory, as this is the better developed formulation of closed system quantum mechanics, and in particular, dealing with questions that involve time in a non-trivial way. We get a very restrictive decoherence condition, that implies that even if we do introduce an environment, there will be very few cases that we can assign probabilities to these histories, but in those cases, the quantum Zeno effect is still present.

Green function theory versus Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for thin magnetic films - In this work we compare numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations and Green function theory (GFT) calculations of thin ferromagnetic films including second order anisotropies. Thereby we concentrate on easy plane systems, i.e. systems for which the anisotropy favors a magnetization parallel to the film plane. We discuss these systems in perpendicular external field, i.e. B parallel to the film normal. GFT results are in good agreement with QMC for high enough fields and temperatures. Below a critical field or a critical temperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other hand QMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicates that there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurations with increasing field or temperature. For slightly tilted external fields a rotation of magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane orientation is found with decreasing temperature.

Matrix Ordered Operator Algebras - We study the question when for a given *-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ a sequence of cones $C_n\in M_n(\mathcal{A})$ can be realized as cones of positive operators in a faithful *-representation of $\mathcal{A}$ on a Hilbert space. A characterization of operator algebras which are completely boundedly isomorphic to $C\sp*$-algebras is presented.

Properly infinite C(X)-algebras and K_1-injectivity - We investigate if a unital C(X)-algebra is properly infinite when all its fibres are properly infinite. We show that this question can be rephrased in several different ways, including the question if every unital properly infinite C*-algebra is K_1-injective. We provide partial answers to these questions, and we show that the general question on proper infiniteness of C(X)-algebras can be reduced to establishing proper infiniteness of a specific C([0,1])-algebra with properly infinite fibres.

An information-based traffic control in a public conveyance system: reduced clustering and enhanced efficiency - A new public conveyance model applicable to buses and trains is proposed in this paper by using stochastic cellular automaton. We have found the optimal density of vehicles, at which the average velocity becomes maximum, significantly depends on the number of stops and passengers behavior of getting on a vehicle at stops. The efficiency of the hail-and-ride system is also discussed by comparing the different behavior of passengers. Moreover, we have found that a big cluster of vehicles is divided into small clusters, by incorporating information of the number of vehicles between successive stops.

A separable deformation of the quaternion group algebra - The Donald-Flanigan conjecture asserts that for any finite group and for any field, the corresponding group algebra can be deformed to a separable algebra. The minimal unsolved instance, namely the quaternion group over a field of characteristic 2 was considered as a counterexample. We present here a separable deformation of the quaternion group algebra. In a sense, the conjecture for any finite group is open again.

On the residue fields of Henselian valued stable fields, II - Let $E$ be a primarily quasilocal field, $M/E$ a finite Galois extension and $D$ a central division $E$-algebra of index divisible by $[M\colon E]$. In addition to the main result of Part I, this part of the paper shows that if the Galois group $G(M/E)$ is not nilpotent, then $M$ does not necessarily embed in $D$ as an $E$-subalgebra. When $E$ is quasilocal, we find the structure of the character group of its absolute Galois group; this enables us to prove that if $E$ is strictly quasilocal and almost perfect, then the divisible part of the multiplicative group $E ^{\ast}$ equals the intersection of the norm groups of finite Galois extensions of $E$.

Chromospheric Cloud-Model Inversion Techniques - Spectral inversion techniques based on the cloud model are extremely useful for the study of properties and dynamics of various chromospheric cloud-like structures. Several inversion techniques are reviewed based on simple (constant source function) and more elaborated cloud models, as well as on grids of synthetic line profiles produced for a wide range of physical parameters by different NLTE codes. Several examples are shown of how such techniques can be used in different chromospheric lines, for the study of structures of the quiet chromosphere, such as mottles/spicules, as well as for active region structures such as fibrils, arch filament systems (AFS), filaments and flares.

Dust covering factor, silicate emission and star formation in luminous QSOs - We present Spitzer IRS low resolution, mid-IR spectra of a sample of 25 high luminosity QSOs at 2<z<3.5. When combined with archival IRS observations of local, low luminosity type-I AGNs, the sample spans five orders of magnitude in luminosity. We find that the continuum dust thermal emission at lambda(rest)=6.7um is correlated with the optical luminosity, following the non-linear relation L(6.7um) propto L(5100A)^0.82. We also find an anti correlation between the ratio L(6.7um)/L(5100A) and the [OIII]5007A line luminosity. These effects are interpreted as a decreasing covering factor of the circumnuclear dust as a function of luminosity. Such a result is in agreement with the decreasing fraction of absorbed AGNs as a function of luminosity recently found in various surveys. We clearly detect the silicate emission feature in the average spectrum, but also in four individual objects. These are the Silicate emission in the most luminous objects obtained so far. When combined with the silicate emission observed in local, low luminosity type-I AGNs, we find that the silicate emission strength is correlated with luminosity. The silicate strength of all type-I AGNs also follows a positive correlation with the black hole mass and with the accretion rate. The Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features, expected from starburst activity, are not detected in the average spectrum of luminous, high-z QSOs. The upper limit inferred from the average spectrum points to a ratio between PAH luminosity and QSO optical luminosity significantly lower than observed in lower luminosity AGNs, implying that the correlation between star formation rate and AGN power saturates at high luminosities.

Generating entanglement of photon-number states with coherent light via cross-Kerr nonlinearity - We propose a scheme for generating entangled states of light fields. This scheme only requires the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between coherent light-beams, followed by a homodyne detection. Therefore, this scheme is within the reach of current technology. We study in detail the generation of the entangled states between two modes, and that among three modes. In addition to the Bell states between two modes and the W states among three modes, we find plentiful new kinds of entangled states. Finally, the scheme can be extend to generate the entangled states among more than three modes.

A parachute for the degree of a polynomial in algebraically independent ones - We give a simpler proof as well as a generalization of the main result of an article of Shestakov and Umirbaev. This latter article being the first of two that solve a long-standing conjecture about the non-tameness, or "wildness", of Nagata's automorphism. As corollaries we get interesting informations about the leading terms of polynomials forming an automorphism in any dimension and reprove the tameness of automorphisms in dimension two.

Galaxy evolution in the infra-red: comparison of a hierarchical galaxy formation model with SPITZER data - We present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function, number counts and redshift distributions in the IR based on the Lambda-CDM cosmological model. We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. The model, which is the same as that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solar neighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavy IMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously that the top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint sub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER Space Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before SPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed evolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed by SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters. On the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far too little evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

Use of Triangular Elements for Nearly Exact BEM Solutions - A library of C functions yielding exact solutions of potential and flux influences due to uniform surface distribution of singularities on flat triangular and rectangular elements has been developed. This library, ISLES, has been used to develop the neBEM solver that is both precise and fast in solving a wide range of problems of scientific and technological interest. Here we present the exact expressions proposed for computing the influence of uniform singularity distributions on triangular elements and illustrate their accuracy. We also present a study concerning the time taken to evaluate these long and complicated expressions \textit{vis a vis} that spent in carrying out simple quadratures. Finally, we solve a classic benchmark problem in electrostatics, namely, estimation of the capacitance of a unit square plate raised to unit volt. For this problem, we present the estimated values of capacitance and compare them successfully with some of the most accurate results available in the literature. In addition, we present the variation of the charge density close to the corner of the plate for various degrees of discretization. The variations are found to be smooth and converging. This is in clear contrast to the criticism commonly leveled against usual BEM solvers.

Entropy of eigenfunctions - We study the high--energy limit for eigenfunctions of the laplacian, on a compact negatively curved manifold. We review the recent result of Anantharaman-Nonnenmacher giving a lower bound on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of semiclassical measures, and improve this lower bound in the case of variable negative curvature.

Vector meson production from a polarized nucleon - We provide a framework to analyze the electroproduction process ep -> ep rho with a polarized target, writing the angular distribution of the rho decay products in terms of spin density matrix elements that parameterize the hadronic subprocess gamma* p -> rho p. Using the helicity basis for both photon and meson, we find a representation in which the expressions for a polarized and unpolarized target are related by simple substitution rules.

The effect of the solar corona on the attenuation of small-amplitude prominence oscillations. I. Longitudinal magnetic field - Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions. Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those observed.

Energy and Momentum Distributions of Kantowski and Sachs Space-time - We use the Einstein, Bergmann-Thomson, Landau-Lifshitz and Papapetrou energy-momentum complexes to calculate the energy and momentum distributions of Kantowski and Sachs space-time. We show that the Einstein and Bergmann-Thomson definitions furnish a consistent result for the energy distribution, but the definition of Landau-Lifshitz do not agree with them. We show that a signature switch should affect about everything including energy distribution in the case of Einstein and Papapetrou prescriptions but not in Bergmann-Thomson and Landau-Lifshitz prescriptions.

Green functions and nonlinear systems: Short time expansion - We show that Green function methods can be straightforwardly applied to nonlinear equations appearing as the leading order of a short time expansion. Higher order corrections can be then computed giving a satisfactory agreement with numerical results. The relevance of these results relies on the possibility of fully exploiting a gradient expansion in both classical and quantum field theory granting the existence of a strong coupling expansion. Having a Green function in this regime in quantum field theory amounts to obtain the corresponding spectrum of the theory.

One-way permutations, computational asymmetry and distortion - Computational asymmetry, i.e., the discrepancy between the complexity of transformations and the complexity of their inverses, is at the core of one-way transformations. We introduce a computational asymmetry function that measures the amount of one-wayness of permutations. We also introduce the word-length asymmetry function for groups, which is an algebraic analogue of computational asymmetry. We relate boolean circuits to words in a Thompson monoid, over a fixed generating set, in such a way that circuit size is equal to word-length. Moreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a Thompson group, in such a way that circuit size is polynomially equivalent to word-length. We show that circuits built with gates that are not constrained to have fixed-length inputs and outputs, are at most quadratically more compact than circuits built from traditional gates (with fixed-length inputs and outputs). Finally, we show that the computational asymmetry function is closely related to certain distortion functions: The computational asymmetry function is polynomially equivalent to the distortion of the path length in Schreier graphs of certain Thompson groups, compared to the path length in Cayley graphs of certain Thompson monoids. We also show that the results of Razborov and others on monotone circuit complexity lead to exponential lower bounds on certain distortions.

A method for the direct determination of the surface gravities of transiting extrasolar planets - We show that the surface gravity of a transiting extrasolar planet can be calculated from only the spectroscopic orbit of its parent star and the analysis of its transit light curve. This does not require additional constraints, such as are often inferred from theoretical stellar models or model atmospheres. The planet's surface gravity can therefore be measured precisely and from only directly observable quantities. We outline the method and apply it to the case of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD 209458b. We find a surface gravity of g_p = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m/s, which is an order of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its mass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lower surface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gas giant planets. We apply our method to all fourteen known transiting extrasolar planets and find a significant correlation between surface gravity and orbital period, which is related to the known correlation between mass and period. This correlation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamental parameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.

On restrictions of balanced 2-interval graphs - The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling and allocation problems, and more recently for specific bioinformatic problems. Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and justify the introduction of a hierarchy of subclasses of 2-interval graphs that generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and (x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs, K_{1,5}-free graphs, ...

Exchange parameters from approximate self-interaction correction scheme - The approximate atomic self-interaction corrections (ASIC) method to density functional theory is put to the test by calculating the exchange interaction for a number of prototypical materials, critical to local exchange and correlation functionals. ASIC total energy calculations are mapped onto an Heisenberg pair-wise interaction and the exchange constants J are compared to those obtained with other methods. In general the ASIC scheme drastically improves the bandstructure, which for almost all the cases investigated resemble closely available photo-emission data. In contrast the results for the exchange parameters are less satisfactory. Although ASIC performs reasonably well for systems where the magnetism originates from half-filled bands, it suffers from similar problems than those of LDA for other situations. In particular the exchange constants are still overestimated. This reflects a subtle interplay between exchange and correlation energy, not captured by the ASIC.

Generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law. The role of unphysical source terms in resonance line polarization transfer and its importance as an additional test of NLTE radiative transfer codes - Context. A derivation of a generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law for nonthermal collisional rates of excitation by charged perturbers is presented. Aims. Aim of this paper is to find a more general analytical expression for a surface value of the source function which can be used as an addtional tool for verification of the non-LTE radiative transfer codes. Methods. Under the impact approximation hypothesis, static, one-dimensional, plane-parallel atmosphere, constant magnetic field of arbitrary strength and direction, two-level atom model with unpolarized lower level and stimulated emission neglected, we introduce the unphysical terms into the equations of statistical equilibrium and solve the appropriate non-LTE integral equations. Results. We derive a new analytical condition for the surface values of the source function components expressed in the basis of irreducible spherical tensors.

Retarded electric and magnetic fields of a moving charge: Feynman's derivation of Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials revisited - Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter, of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors. The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.

On the characterization of isotropic Gaussian fields on homogeneous spaces of compact groups - Let T be a random field invariant under the action of a compact group G We give conditions ensuring that independence of the random Fourier coefficients is equivalent to Gaussianity. As a consequence, in general it is not possible to simulate a non-Gaussian invariant random field through its Fourier expansion using independent coefficients.

A Catalog of Star Cluster Candidates in M33 - We present a new catalog of star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy M33. It is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we have cross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistencies between them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmed clusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog contains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the UBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large Magellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to 10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the dN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich. Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33 field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater than 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and discussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more complete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square degrees centered on M33.

Sharp dark-mode resonances in planar metamaterials with broken structural symmetry - We report that resonant response with a very high quality factor can be achieved in a planar metamaterial by introducing symmetry breaking in the shape of its structural elements, which enables excitation of dark modes, i.e. modes that are weakly coupled to free space.

Proper motion L and T dwarf candidate members of the Pleiades - We present the results of a deep optical-near-infrared multi-epoch survey covering 2.5 square degrees of the Pleiades open star cluster to search for new very-low-mass brown dwarf members. A significant (~ 5 year) epoch difference exists between the optical (CFH12k I-, Z-band) and near infrared (UKIRT WFCAM J-band) observations. We construct I,I-Z and Z,Z-J colour magnitude diagrams to select candidate cluster members. Proper motions are computed for all candidate members and compared to the background field objects to further refine the sample. We recover all known cluster members within the area of our survey. In addition, we have discovered 9 new candidate brown dwarf cluster members. The 7 faintest candidates have red Z-J colours and show blue near-infrared colours. These are consistent with being L and T-type Pleiads. Theoretical models predict their masses to be around 11 Jupiter masses. There is 1 errata for this paper

A Study of Catalogued Nearby Galaxy Clusters in the SDSS-DR4: I. Cluster Global Properties - We have selected a sample of 88 nearby (z<0.1) galaxy clusters from the SDSS-DR4 with redshift information for the cluster members. We have derived global properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity, velocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped in two families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of 10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The brightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the smallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity dispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the outermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing velocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the fraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster velocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results indicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution. Thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than early-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the cluster global properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones. These observational results suggest that the global environment could be important for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster ($\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1}$). However, the local environment could play a key role in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.

Optical implementation and entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence bond states - We study Gaussian valence bond states of continuous variable systems, obtained as the outputs of projection operations from an ancillary space of M infinitely entangled bonds connecting neighboring sites, applied at each of $N$ sites of an harmonic chain. The entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence bond states can be controlled by varying the input amount of entanglement engineered in a (2M+1)-mode Gaussian state known as the building block, which is isomorphic to the projector applied at a given site. We show how this mechanism can be interpreted in terms of multiple entanglement swapping from the chain of ancillary bonds, through the building blocks. We provide optical schemes to produce bisymmetric three-mode Gaussian building blocks (which correspond to a single bond, M=1), and study the entanglement structure in the output Gaussian valence bond states. The usefulness of such states for quantum communication protocols with continuous variables, like telecloning and teleportation networks, is finally discussed.

Rich magnetic phase diagram in the Kagome-staircase compound Mn3V2O8 - Mn3V2O8 is a magnetic system in which S = 5/2 Mn2+ is found in the kagome staircase lattice. Here we report the magnetic phase diagram for temperatures above 2 K and applied magnetic fields below 9 T, characterized by measurements of the magnetization and specific heat with field along the three unique lattice directions. At low applied magnetic fields, the system first orders magnetically below Tm1 ~ 21 K, and then shows a second magnetic phase transition at Tm2 ~ 15 K. In addition, a phase transition that is apparent in specific heat but not seen in magnetization is found for all three applied field orientations, converging towards Tm2 as H -> 0. The magnetic behavior is highly anisotropic, with critical fields for magnetic phase boundaries much higher when the field is applied perpendicular to the Kagome staircase plane than when applied in-plane. The field-temperature (H - T) phase diagrams are quite rich, with 7 distinct phases observed.

L^2-Betti numbers of coamenable quantum groups - We prove that a compact quantum group is coamenable if and only if its corepresentation ring is amenable. We further propose a Foelner condition for compact quantum groups and prove it to be equivalent to coamenability. Using this Foelner condition, we prove that for a coamenable compact quantum group with tracial Haar state, the enveloping von Neumann algebra is dimension flat over the Hopf algebra of matrix coefficients. This generalizes a theorem of Lueck from the group case to the quantum group case, and provides examples of compact quantum groups with vanishing L^2-Betti numbers.

OPserver: interactive online-computations of opacities and radiative accelerations - Codes to compute mean opacities and radiative accelerations for arbitrary chemical mixtures using the Opacity Project recently revised data have been restructured in a client--server architecture and transcribed as a subroutine library. This implementation increases efficiency in stellar modelling where element stratification due to diffusion processes is depth dependent, and thus requires repeated fast opacity reestimates. Three user modes are provided to fit different computing environments, namely a web browser, a local workstation and a distributed grid.

Can One Estimate The Unconditional Distribution of Post-Model-Selection Estimators? - We consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of a post-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model (e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing procedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by least-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally). This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection estimator.

Fixed Phase Quantum Search Algorithm - Building quantum devices using fixed operators is a must to simplify the hardware construction. Quantum search engine is not an exception. In this paper, a fixed phase quantum search algorithm that searches for M matches in an unstructured search space of size N will be presented. Selecting phase shifts of 1.91684\pi in the standard amplitude amplification will make the technique perform better so as to get probability of success at least 99.58% in O(sqrt(N/M)) better than any know fixed operator quantum search algorithms. The algorithm will be able to handle either a single match or multiple matches in the search space. The algorithm will find a match in O(sqrt(N/M)) whether the number of matches is known or not in advance.

Core excitation in the elastic scattering and breakup of $^{11}$Be on protons - The elastic scattering and breakup of $^{11}$Be from a proton target at intermediate energies is studied. We explore the role of core excitation in the reaction mechanism. Comparison with the data suggests that there is still missing physics in the description.

Possible X-ray diagnostic for jet/disk dominance in Type 1 AGN - Using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Seyfert 1 and 1.2 data spanning 9 years, we study correlations between X-ray spectral features. The sample consists of 350 time-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the black hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2, but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely the result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample as a whole, but not for the individual galaxies and galaxy types.

On algebraic automorphisms and their rational invariants - Let X be an affine irreducible variety over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero. Given an automorphism F, we denote by k(X)^F its field of invariants, i.e. the set of rational functions f on X such that f(F)=f. Let n(F) be the transcendence degree of k(X)^F over k. In this paper, we study the class of automorphisms F of X for which n(F)= dim X - 1. More precisely, we show that under some conditions on X, every such automorphism is of the form F=A_g, where A is an algebraic action of a linear algebraic group G of dimension 1 on X, and where g belongs to G. As an application, we determine the conjugacy classes of automorphisms of the plane for which n(F)=1.

Improving immunization strategies - We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.

Constraints on the Very Early Universe from Thermal WIMP Dark Matter - We investigate the relic density n_\chi of non-relativistic long-lived or stable particles \chi in non-standard cosmological scenarios. We calculate the relic abundance starting from arbitrary initial temperatures of the radiation-dominated epoch, and derive the lower bound on the initial temperature T_0 \geq m_\chi/23, assuming that thermally produced \chi particles account for the dark matter energy density in the universe; this bound holds for all \chi annihilation cross sections. We also investigate cosmological scenarios with modified expansion rate. Even in this case an approximate formula similar to the standard one is capable of predicting the final relic abundance correctly. Choosing the \chi annihilation cross section such that the observed cold dark matter abundance is reproduced in standard cosmology, we constrain possible modifications of the expansion rate at T \sim m_\chi/20, well before Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

Flavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis - We reanalyse leptogenesis via the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest right-handed neutrino in type II seesaw scenarios, taking into account flavour-dependent effects. In the type II seesaw mechanism, in addition to the type I seesaw contribution, an additional direct mass term for the light neutrinos is present. We consider type II seesaw scenarios where this additional contribution arises from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs triplet, and furthermore an effective model-independent approach. We investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early universe, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw framework. We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesis becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the bounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes more constrained. We also argue that in general, flavour-dependent effects cannot be ignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II seesaw models.

Multi-wavelength Analysis of a Quiet Solar Region - We present observations of a solar quiet region obtained by the ground-based Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), and by instruments on the spacecraft SOHO and TRACE. The observations were obtained during a coordinated observing campaign on October 2005. The aim of this work is to present the rich diversity of fine-scale structures that are found at the network boundaries and their appearance in different instruments and different spectral lines that span the photosphere to the corona. Detailed studies of these structures are crucial to understanding their dynamics in different solar layers, as well as the role such structures play in the mass balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.

Orbital currents in the Colle-Salvetti correlation energy functional and the degeneracy problem - Popular density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy typically fail to reproduce the degeneracy of different ground states of open-shell atoms. As a remedy, functionals which explicitly depend on the current density have been suggested. We present an analysis of this problem by investigating functionals that explicitly depend on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Going beyond the exact-exchange approximation by adding correlation in the form of the Colle-Salvetti functional we show how current-dependent terms enter the Colle-Salvetti expression and their relevance is evaluated. A very good description of the degeneracy of ground-states for atoms of the first and second row of the periodic table is obtained.

Cooper pairs in atomic nuclei - We consider the development of Cooper pairs in a self-consistent Hartree Fock mean field for the even Sm isotopes. Results are presented at the level of a BCS treatment, a number-projected BCS treatment and an exact treatment using the Richardson ansatz. While projected BCS captures much of the pairing correlation energy that is absent from BCS, it still misses a sizable correlation energy, typically of order $1 MeV$. Furthermore, because it does not average over the properties of the fermion pairs, the exact Richardson solution permits a more meaningful definition of the Cooper wave function and of the fraction of pairs that are collective.

An adaptive numerical method for the Vlasov equation based on a multiresolution analysis - In this paper, we present very first results for the adaptive solution on a grid of the phase space of the Vlasov equation arising in particles accelarator and plasma physics. The numerical algorithm is based on a semi-Lagrangian method while adaptivity is obtained using multiresolution analysis.

Turbulence and the Navier-Stokes equations - The concept of continuous topological evolution, based upon Cartan's methods of exterior differential systems, is used to develop a topological theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, within which there exist processes that exhibit continuous topological change and thermodynamic irreversibility. The technique furnishes a universal, topological foundation for the partial differential equations of hydrodynamics and electrodynamics; the technique does not depend upon a metric, connection or a variational principle. Certain topological classes of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are shown to be equivalent to thermodynamically irreversible processes.

Numerical estimation of critical parameters using the Bond entropy - Using a model of spinless fermions in a lattice with nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor interaction we show that the entropy of the reduced two site density matrix (the bond entropy) can be used as an extremely accurate and easy to calculate numerical indicator for the critical parameters of the quantum phase transition when the basic ordering pattern has a two-site periodicity. The actual behavior of the bond entropy depends on the particular characteristics of the transition under study. For the Kosterlitz-Thouless type phase transition from a Luttinger liquid phase to a charge density wave state the bond entropy has a local maximum while in the transition from the Luttinger liquid to the phase separated state the derivative of the bond entropy has a divergence due to the cancelation of the third eigenvalue of the two-site reduced density matrix.

Radiative transitions of the helium atom in highly magnetized neutron star atmospheres - Recent observations of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars revealed spectral features that could be interpreted as radiative transitions of He in a magnetized neutron star atmosphere. We present Hartree-Fock calculations of the polarization-dependent photoionization cross sections of the He atom in strong magnetic fields ranging from 10^12 G to 10^14 G. Convenient fitting formulae for the cross sections are given as well as related oscillator strengths for various bound-bound transitions. The effects of finite nucleus mass on the radiative absorption cross sections are examined using perturbation theory.

Critical points for surface maps and the Benedicks-Carleson theorem - We give an alternative proof of the Benedicks-Carleson theorem on the existence of strange attractors in H\'enon-like families in the plane. To bypass a huge inductive argument, we introduce an induction-free explicit definition of dynamically critical points. The argument is sufficiently general and in particular applies to the case of non-invertible maps as well. It naturally raises the question of an intrinsic characterization of dynamically critical points for dissipative surface maps.

The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey. The Assembly History of the Stellar Mass in Galaxies: from the Young to the Old Universe - We present a detailed analysis of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function of galaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the VVDS. We estimate the stellar mass from broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy star formation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to a continuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%) stellar masses. At low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population of low-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (M_I-M_K=0.3). In general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and more significantly above this redshift. Conversely, a massive tail is present up to z=2.5 and have extremely red colours (M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8). We find a decline with redshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% for M>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution (`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible (<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For less massive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. A large fraction (>=50%) of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gas into stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of their assembly history below z=1. This fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. Low-mass systems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor up to 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assembly also at z<1.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking of solitons trapped in a double-channel potential - We consider a two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear Schrodinger equation with self-focusing nonlinearity and a quasi-1D double-channel potential, i.e., a straightforward 2D extension of the well-known double-well potential. The model may be realized in terms of nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. The variational approximation (VA) predicts a bifurcation breaking the symmetry of 2D solitons trapped in the double channel, the bifurcation being of the subcritical type. The predictions of the VA are confirmed by numerical simulations. The work presents the first example of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2D solitons in any dual-core system.

What does Hirsch index evolution explain us? A case study: Turkish Journal of Chemistry - The evolution of Turkish Journal of Chemistry (Turk J. Chem) Hirsch index (h-index) over the period 1995-2005 is studied and determined in the case of the self and without self-citations. It is seen that the effect of Hirsch index of Turk J. Chem has a highly positive trend during the last five years. It proves that Turk J. Chem is improving itself both in quantity and quality since h-index reflects peer review, and peer review reflects research quality of a journal.

Measuring energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using Compton scattering in PoGOLite - Linear polarization in X- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of many astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry, magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures. In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization from cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with the proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use Geant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus X-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6 and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration flight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the polarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy, for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be rejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50% polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0% polarization.

Baryon Number-Induced Chern-Simons Couplings of Vector and Axial-Vector Mesons in Holographic QCD - We show that holographic models of QCD predict the presence of a Chern-Simons coupling between vector and axial-vector mesons at finite baryon density. In the AdS/CFT dictionary, the coefficient of this coupling is proportional to the baryon number density, and is fixed uniquely in the five-dimensional holographic dual by anomalies in the flavor currents. For the lightest mesons, the coupling mixes transverse $\rho$ and $a_1$ polarization states. At sufficiently large baryon number densities, it produces an instability, which causes the $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons to condense in a state breaking both rotational and translational invariance.

Total Quantum Zeno Effect beyond Zeno Time - In this work we show that is possible to obtain Total Quantum Zeno Effect in an unstable systems for times larger than the correlation time of the bath. The effect is observed for some particular systems in which one can chose appropriate observables which frequent measurements freeze the system into the initial state. For a two level system in a squeezed bath one can show that there are two bath dependent observables displaying Total Zeno Effect when the system is initialized in some particular states. We show also that these states are intelligent states of two conjugate observables associated to the electromagnetic fluctuations of the bath.

Asteroseismic Signatures of Stellar Magnetic Activity Cycles - Observations of stellar activity cycles provide an opportunity to study magnetic dynamos under many different physical conditions. Space-based asteroseismology missions will soon yield useful constraints on the interior conditions that nurture such magnetic cycles, and will be sensitive enough to detect shifts in the oscillation frequencies due to the magnetic variations. We derive a method for predicting these shifts from changes in the Mg II activity index by scaling from solar data. We demonstrate this technique on the solar-type subgiant beta Hyi, using archival International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra and two epochs of ground-based asteroseismic observations. We find qualitative evidence of the expected frequency shifts and predict the optimal timing for future asteroseismic observations of this star.

Anomalous energy transport in the FPU-beta chain - We consider the energy current correlation function for the FPU-beta lattice. For small non-linearity one can rely on kinetic theory. The issue reduces then to a spectral analysis of the linearized collision operator. We prove thereby that, on the basis of kinetic theory, the energy current correlations decay in time as t^(-3/5). It follows that the thermal conductivity is anomalous, increasing as N^(2/5) with the system size N.

Diffractive parton distributions from the analysis with higher twist - Diffractive parton distributions of the proton are determined from fits to diffractive data from HERA. In addition to the twist--2 contribution, the twist--4 contribution from longitudinally polarised virtual photons is considered, which is important in the region of small diffractive masses. A new prediction for the longitudinal diffractive structure function is presented which differs significantly from that obtained in the pure twist--2 analyses.

GRB 061121: Broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and afterglow phases of a bright burst - Swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of GRB 061121 (z=1.314), allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many other telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes Telescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from 1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models. Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a combination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of 2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is detected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for the beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

High-altitude signatures of ionospheric density depletions caused by field-aligned currents - We present Cluster measurements of large electric fields correlated with intense downward field-aligned currents, and show that the data can be reproduced by a simple model of ionospheric plasma depletion caused by the currents. This type of magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction may be important when considering the mapping between these two regions of space.

Burgers Turbulence - The last decades witnessed a renewal of interest in the Burgers equation. Much activities focused on extensions of the original one-dimensional pressureless model introduced in the thirties by the Dutch scientist J.M. Burgers, and more precisely on the problem of Burgers turbulence, that is the study of the solutions to the one- or multi-dimensional Burgers equation with random initial conditions or random forcing. Such work was frequently motivated by new emerging applications of Burgers model to statistical physics, cosmology, and fluid dynamics. Also Burgers turbulence appeared as one of the simplest instances of a nonlinear system out of equilibrium. The study of random Lagrangian systems, of stochastic partial differential equations and their invariant measures, the theory of dynamical systems, the applications of field theory to the understanding of dissipative anomalies and of multiscaling in hydrodynamic turbulence have benefited significantly from progress in Burgers turbulence. The aim of this review is to give a unified view of selected work stemming from these rather diverse disciplines.

Analytical evaluation of the X-ray scattering contribution to imaging degradation in grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes - The focusing performance of X-ray optics (conveniently expressed in terms of HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon scattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular, the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS), the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...] Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope. We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given H(E) requirement. [...]

Reply to ``Comment on `On the inconsistency of the Bohm-Gadella theory with quantum mechanics''' - In this reply, we show that when we apply standard distribution theory to the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the resulting spaces of test functions would comply with the Hardy axiom only if classic results of Paley and Wiener, of Gelfand and Shilov, and of the theory of ultradistributions were wrong. As well, we point out several differences between the ``standard method'' of constructing rigged Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics and the method used in Time Asymmetric Quantum Theory.

Modelling the Galactic bar using OGLE-II Red Clump Giant Stars - Red clump giant stars can be used as distance indicators to trace the mass distribution of the Galactic bar. We use RCG stars from 44 bulge fields from the OGLE-II microlensing collaboration database to constrain analytic tri-axial models for the Galactic bar. We find the bar major axis is oriented at an angle of 24 - 27 degrees to the Sun-Galactic centre line-of-sight. The ratio of semi-major and semi-minor bar axis scale lengths in the Galactic plane x_0, y_0, and vertical bar scale length z_0, is x_0 : y_0 : z_0 = 10 : 3.5 : 2.6, suggesting a slightly more prolate bar structure than the working model of Gerhard (2002) which gives the scale length ratios as x_0 : y_0 : z_0 = 10 : 4 : 3 .

Dynamical Coupled-Channel Model of $\pi N$ Scattering in the W $\leq$ 2 GeV Nucleon Resonance Region - As a first step to analyze the electromagnetic meson production reactions in the nucleon resonance region, the parameters of the hadronic interactions of a dynamical coupled-channel model, developed in {\it Physics Reports 439, 193 (2007)}, are determined by fitting the $\pi N$ scattering data. The channels included in the calculations are $\pi N$, $\eta N$ and $\pi\pi N$ which has $\pi\Delta$, $\rho N$, and $\sigma N$ resonant components. The non-resonant meson-baryon interactions of the model are derived from a set of Lagrangians by using a unitary transformation method. One or two bare excited nucleon states in each of $S$, $P$, $D$, and $F$ partial waves are included to generate the resonant amplitudes in the fits. The parameters of the model are first determined by fitting as much as possible the empirical $\pi N$ elastic scattering amplitudes of SAID up to 2 GeV. We then refine and confirm the resulting parameters by directly comparing the predicted differential cross section and target polarization asymmetry with the original data of the elastic $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$ and charge-exchange $\pi^- p \to \pi^0 n$ processes. The predicted total cross sections of $\pi N$ reactions and $\pi N\to \eta N$ reactions are also in good agreement with the data. Applications of the constructed model in analyzing the electromagnetic meson production data as well as the future developments are discussed.

High-resolution study of a star-forming cluster in the Cep-A HW2 region - Due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the Cepheus A East star-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formation processes. Based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattened molecular gas distribution around the YSO HW2 may be a 350-AU-radius massive protostellar disk. Goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of this structure. We have employed the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to acquire (sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such as methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO), towards the HW2 position. On the 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular gas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane of the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one is powering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line of sight. The presence of a protostellar disk around HW2 is not ruled out, but such structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or using different molecular tracers.

A Renormalization group approach for highly anisotropic 2D Fermion systems: application to coupled Hubbard chains - I apply a two-step density-matrix renormalization group method to the anisotropic two-dimensional Hubbard model. As a prelude to this study, I compare the numerical results to the exact one for the tight-binding model. I find a ground-state energy which agrees with the exact value up to four digits for systems as large as $24 \times 25$. I then apply the method to the interacting case. I find that for strong Hubbard interaction, the ground-state is dominated by magnetic correlations. These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration. Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels and it is not enhanced by frustration. For weak Hubbard couplings, interchain non-local singlet pair tunneling is enhanced and magnetic correlations are strongly reduced. This suggests a possible superconductive ground state.

Proper Motion Dispersions of Red Clump Giants in the Galactic Bulge: Observations and Model Comparisons - Red clump giants in the Galactic bulge are approximate standard candles and hence they can be used as distance indicators. We compute the proper motion dispersions of RCG stars in the Galactic bulge using the proper motion catalogue from the second phase of the Optical Gravitational Microlensing Experiment (OGLE-II, Sumi et al. 2004) for 45 fields. The proper motion dispersions are measured to a few per cent accuracy due to the large number of stars in the fields. The observational sample is comprised of 577736 stars. These observed data are compared to a state-of-the-art particle simulation of the Galactic bulge region. The predictions are in rough agreement with observations, but appear to be too anisotropic in the velocity ellipsoid. We note that there is significant field-to-field variation in the observed proper motion dispersions. This could either be a real feature, or due to some unknown systematic effect.

Intramolecular long-range correlations in polymer melts: The segmental size distribution and its moments - Presenting theoretical arguments and numerical results we demonstrate long-range intrachain correlations in concentrated solutions and melts of long flexible polymers which cause a systematic swelling of short chain segments. They can be traced back to the incompressibility of the melt leading to an effective repulsion $u(s) \approx s/\rho R^3(s) \approx ce/\sqrt{s}$ when connecting two segments together where $s$ denotes the curvilinear length of a segment, $R(s)$ its typical size, $ce \approx 1/\rho be^3$ the ``swelling coefficient", $be$ the effective bond length and $\rho$ the monomer density. The relative deviation of the segmental size distribution from the ideal Gaussian chain behavior is found to be proportional to $u(s)$. The analysis of different moments of this distribution allows for a precise determination of the effective bond length $be$ and the swelling coefficient $ce$ of asymptotically long chains. At striking variance to the short-range decay suggested by Flory's ideality hypothesis the bond-bond correlation function of two bonds separated by $s$ monomers along the chain is found to decay algebraically as $1/s^{3/2}$. Effects of finite chain length are considered briefly.

Stability Properties of Strongly Magnetized Spine Sheath Relativistic Jets - The linearized relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations describing a uniform axially magnetized cylindrical relativistic jet spine embedded in a uniform axially magnetized relativistically moving sheath are derived. The displacement current is retained in the equations so that effects associated with Alfven wave propagation near light speed can be studied. A dispersion relation for the normal modes is obtained. Analytical solutions for the normal modes in the low and high frequency limits are found and a general stability condition is determined. A trans-Alfvenic and even a super-Alfvenic relativistic jet spine can be stable to velocity shear driven Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. The resonance condition for maximum growth of the normal modes is obtained in the kinetically and magnetically dominated regimes. Numerical solution of the dispersion relation verifies the analytical solutions and is used to study the regime of high sound and Alfven speeds.

MATLAB codes for teaching quantum physics: Part 1 - Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course, we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to column vectors (kets) and that differential operators correspond to matrices (ket-bras) acting on those vectors. The MATLAB (matrix-laboratory) programming environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.

Nanodevices and Maxwell's Demon - In the last twenty years there has been significant progress in our understanding of quantum transport far from equilibrium and a conceptual framework has emerged through a combination of the Landauer approach with the non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method, which is now being widely used in the analysis and design of nanoscale devices. It provides a unified description for all kinds of devices from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes to silicon transistors covering different transport regimes from the ballistic to the diffusive limit. In this talk I use a simple version of this model to analyze a specially designed device that could be called an electronic Maxwell's demon, one that lets electrons go preferentially in one direction over another. My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts and demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an academic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative devices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology. For example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular conductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon device itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has been studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of the possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a refrigerator as proposed here. However, my objective is not to evaluate possible practical applications. Rather it is to introduce a simple transparent model showing how out-of-equibrium demons suitably incorporated into nanodevices can achieve energy conversion.

Complete Segal spaces arising from simplicial categories - In this paper, we compare several functors which take simplicial categories or model categories to complete Segal spaces, which are particularly nice simplicial spaces which, like simplicial categories, can be considered to be models for homotopy theories. We then give a characterization, up to weak equivalence, of complete Segal spaces arising from these functors.

A Systematic Scan for 7-colourings of the Grid - We study the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling from the uniform distribution on proper 7-colourings of a finite rectangular sub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid. A systematic scan Markov chain cycles through finite-size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order and updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset. The systematic scan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2 sub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure known as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan Markov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular sub-grid. We make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of colourings of 2x2 sub-grids. This is the first time the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than 8 colours. We also give partial results that underline the challenges of proving rapid mixing of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling 6-colourings of the grid by considering 2x3 and 3x3 sub-grids.

Magnetic exponents of two-dimensional Ising spin glasses - The magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional Ising spin glasses are controversial. Using exact ground state determination, we extract the properties of clusters flipped when increasing continuously a uniform field. We show that these clusters have many holes but otherwise have statistical properties similar to those of zero-field droplets. A detailed analysis gives for the magnetization exponent delta = 1.30 +/- 0.02 using lattice sizes up to 80x80; this is compatible with the droplet model prediction delta = 1.282. The reason for previous disagreements stems from the need to analyze both singular and analytic contributions in the low-field regime.

Thin elastic shells with variable thickness for lithospheric flexure of one-plate planets - Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

Detection of single electron spin resonance in a double quantum dot - Spin-dependent transport measurements through a double quantum dot are a valuable tool for detecting both the coherent evolution of the spin state of a single electron as well as the hybridization of two-electron spin states. In this paper, we discuss a model that describes the transport cycle in this regime, including the effects of an oscillating magnetic field (causing electron spin resonance) and the effective nuclear fields on the spin states in the two dots. We numerically calculate the current flow due to the induced spin flips via electron spin resonance and we study the detector efficiency for a range of parameters. The experimental data are compared with the model and we find a reasonable agreement.

Donor type semiconductor at low temperature as maser active medium - In some semiconductors donor impurity atoms can attract additional electrons, forming negative donor impurity ions. Thus we have 3 energy levels for electrons: zero energy levels at the bottom of the conductivity band, negative energy levels of the bounded electrons of the negative donor impurity ions, and deeper negative energy levels of the outer electrons of the neutral donor impurity atoms. So the donor impurity atoms could serve as active centres for a maser. The maximum achievable relative population is 0.5. Typical wavelength of the generated oscillation is 0.14 mm; three level scheme could be realized at rather low temperatures, considerably lower than 6 K.

Exciting the Magnetosphere of the Magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 in Westerlund 1 - We describe XMM-Newton observations taken 4.3 days prior to and 1.5 days subsequent to two remarkable events that were detected with Swift on 2006 September 21 from the candidate magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216: (1) a 20 ms burst with an energy of 1e37 erg (15-150 keV), and (2) a rapid spin-down (glitch) with a fractionap period change of 1e-4. We find that the luminosity of the pulsar increased by a factor of 100 in the interval between observations, from 1e33 to 1e35 erg/s (0.5-8.0 keV), and that its spectrum hardened. The pulsed count rate increased by a factor of 10 (0.5-8.0 keV), but the fractional rms amplitude of the pulses decreased from 65 to 11 per cent, and their profile changed from being single-peaked to exhibiting three peaks. Similar changes have been observed from other magnetars in response to outbursts, such as that of 1E 2259+586 in 2002 June. We suggest that a plastic deformation of the neutron star's crust induced a very slight twist in the external magnetic field, which in turn generated currents in the magnetosphere that were the direct cause of the X-ray outburst.

Further Evidence that the Redshifts of AGN Galaxies May Contain Intrinsic Components - In the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model galaxies are assumed to be born as compact objects that have been ejected with large intrinsic redshift components, z_(i), out of the nuclei of mature AGN galaxies. As young AGN (quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies but their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and they evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented here that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to radio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that the high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been pushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large intrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z = 0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in luminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the cosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to be associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material used to build galaxies. Whether it might be possible in the CR model to explain these results by selection effects is also examined.

Semiclassical scattering amplitude at the maximum point of the potential - We compute the scattering amplitude for Schr\"odinger operators at a critical energy level, corresponding to the maximum point of the potential. We follow the wrok of Robert and Tamura, '89, using Isozaki and Kitada's representation formula for the scattering amplitude, together with results from Bony, Fujiie, Ramond and Zerzeri '06 in order to analyze the contribution of trapped trajectories.

Hilbert Spaces with Generic Predicates - We study the model theory of expansions of Hilbert spaces by generic predicates. We first prove the existence of model companions for generic expansions of Hilbert spaces in the form first of a distance function to a random substructure, then a distance to a random subset. The theory obtained with the random substructure is {\omega}-stable, while the one obtained with the distance to a random subset is $TP_2$ and $NSOP_1$. That example is the first continuous structure in that class.

Riggings of locally compact abelian groups - We obtain a set of generalized eigenvectors that provides a generalized spectral decomposition for a given unitary representation of a commutative, locally compact topological group. These generalized eigenvectors are functionals belonging to the dual space of a rigging on the space of square integrable functions on the character group. These riggings are obtained through suitable spectral measure spaces.

Weak Amenability of Hyperbolic Groups - We prove that hyperbolic groups are weakly amenable. This partially extends the result of Cowling and Haagerup showing that lattices in simple Lie groups of real rank one are weakly amenable. We take a combinatorial approach in the spirit of Haagerup and prove that for the word length metric d on a hyperbolic group, the Schur multipliers associated with r^d have uniformly bounded norms for 0<r<1. We then combine this with a Bozejko-Picardello type inequality to obtain weak amenability.

Light Curves of Dwarf Plutonian Planets and other Large Kuiper Belt Objects: Their Rotations, Phase Functions and Absolute Magnitudes - (Abridged) I report new light curves and determine the rotations and phase functions of several large Kuiper Belt objects, including the dwarf planet Eris (2003 UB313). (120348) 2004 TY364 shows a light curve which if double-peaked has a period of 11.70+-0.01 hours and peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.22+-0.02 magnitudes. (84922) 2003 VS2 has a well defined double-peaked light curve of 7.41+-0.02 hours with a 0.21+-0.02 magnitude range. (126154) 2001 YH140 shows variability of 0.21+-0.04 magnitudes with a possible 13.25+-0.2 hour single-peaked period. The seven new KBOs in the sample which show no discernible variations within the uncertainties on short rotational time scales are 2001 UQ18, (55565) 2002 AW197, (119979) 2002 WC19, (120132) 2003 FY128, (136108) Eris 2003 UB313, (90482) Orcus 2004 DW, and (90568) 2004 GV9. The three medium to large sized Kuiper Belt objects 2004 TY364, Orcus and 2004 GV9 show fairly steep linear phase curves (~0.18 to 0.26 mags per degree) between phase angles of 0.1 and 1.5 degrees. The extremely large dwarf planet Eris (2003 UB313) shows a shallower phase curve (0.09+-0.03 mags per degree) which is more similar to the other known dwarf planet Pluto. It appears the surface properties of the largest dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt maybe different than the smaller Kuiper Belt objects. This may have to do with the larger objects ability to hold more volatile ices as well as sustain atmospheres. The absolute magnitudes obtained using the measured phase slopes are a few tenths of magnitudes different from those given by the MPC.

Fischler-Susskind holographic cosmology revisited - When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible with the Holographic Principle.

Accelerated expansion of the Universe filled up with the scalar gravitons - The concept of the scalar graviton as the source of the dark matter and dark energy of the gravitaional origin is applied to study the evolution of the isotropic homogeneous Universe. A realistic self-consistent solution to the modified pure gravity equations, which correctly describes the accelerated expansion of the spatially flat Universe, is found and investigated. It is argued that the scenario with the scalar gravitons filling up the Universe may emulate the LCDM model, reducing thus the true dark matter to an artefact.

Parity doubling in particle physics - Parity doubling in excited hadrons is reviewed. Parity degeneracy in hadrons was first experimentally observed 40 years ago. Recently new experimental data on light mesons caused much excitement and renewed interest to the phenomenon, which still remains to be enigmatic. The present retrospective review is an attempt to trace the history of parity doubling phenomenon, thus providing a kind of introduction to the subject. We begin with early approaches of 1960s (Regge theory and dynamical symmetries) and end up with the latest trends (manifestations of broader degeneracies and AdS/QCD). We show the evolution of various ideas about parity doubling. The experimental evidence for this phenomenon is scrutinized in the non-strange sector. Some experiments of 1960s devoted to the search for missing non-strange bosons are re-examined and it is argued that results of these experiments are encouraging from the modern perspective.

Bergman kernels and equilibrium measures for ample line bundles - Let L be an ample holomorphic line bundle over a compact complex Hermitian manifold X. Any fixed smooth Hermitian metric on L induces a Hilbert space structure on the space of global holomorphic sections with values in the k:th tensor power of L. In this paper various convergence results are obtained for the corresponding Bergman kernels. The convergence is studied in the large k limit and is expressed in terms of the equilibrium metric associated to the fixed metric, as well as in terms of the Monge-Ampere measure of the fixed metric itself on a certain support set. It is also shown that the equilibrium metric has Lipschitz continuous first derivatives. These results can be seen as generalizations of well-known results concerning the case when the curvature of the fixed metric is positive (the corresponding equilibrium metric is then simply the fixed metric itself).

U Geminorum: a test case for orbital parameters determination - High-resolution spectroscopy of U Gem was obtained during quiescence. We did not find a hot spot or gas stream around the outer boundaries of the accretion disk. Instead, we detected a strong narrow emission near the location of the secondary star. We measured the radial velocity curve from the wings of the double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value that is in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in the ultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al. (1998). We present also a new method to obtain K_2, which enhances the detection of absorption or emission features arising in the late-type companion. Our results are compared with published values derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison of the TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit is obtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at that spectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect accurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em = 107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by Zhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD = 1.20+/-0.05 M_sun,; M_RD = 0.42+/-0.04 M_sun; and a = 1.55+/- 0.02 R_sun. Based on the separation of the double emission peaks, we calculate an outer disk radius of R_out/a ~0.61, close to the distance of the inner Lagrangian point L_1/a~0.63. Therefore we suggest that, at the time of observations, the accretion disk was filling the Roche-Lobe of the primary, and that the matter leaving the L_1 point was colliding with the disc directly, producing the hot spot at this location.

Collective excitations of hard-core Bosons at half filling on square and triangular lattices: Development of roton minima and collapse of roton gap - We study ground state properties and excitation spectra for hard-core Bosons on square and triangular lattices, at half filling, using series expansion methods. Nearest-neighbor repulsion between the Bosons leads to the development of short-range density order at the antiferromagnetic wavevector, and simultaneously a roton minima in the density excitation spectra. On the square-lattice, the model maps on to the well studied XXZ model, and the roton gap collapses to zero precisely at the Heisenberg symmetry point, leading to the well known spectra for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. On the triangular-lattice, the collapse of the roton gap signals the onset of the supersolid phase. Our results suggest that the transition from the superfluid to the supersolid phase maybe weakly first order. We also find several features in the density of states, including two-peaks and a sharp discontinuity, which maybe observable in experimental realization of such systems.

The LIL for $U$-statistics in Hilbert spaces - We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the (bounded) law of the iterated logarithm for $U$-statistics in Hilbert spaces. As a tool we also develop moment and tail estimates for canonical Hilbert-space valued $U$-statistics of arbitrary order, which are of independent interest.

Circulating Current States in Bilayer Fermionic and Bosonic Systems - It is shown that fermionic polar molecules or atoms in a bilayer optical lattice can undergo the transition to a state with circulating currents, which spontaneously breaks the time reversal symmetry. Estimates of relevant temperature scales are given and experimental signatures of the circulating current phase are identified. Related phenomena in bosonic and spin systems with ring exchange are discussed.

Non-Relativistic Propagators via Schwinger's Method - In order to popularize the so called Schwinger's method we reconsider the Feynman propagator of two non-relativistic systems: a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field and a charged harmonic oscillator in a uniform magnetic field. Instead of solving the Heisenberg equations for the position and the canonical momentum operators, ${\bf R}$ and ${\bf P}$, we apply this method by solving the Heisenberg equations for the gauge invariant operators ${\bf R}$ and $\mathversion{bold}${\pi}$ = {\bf P}-e{\bf A}$, the latter being the mechanical momentum operator. In our procedure we avoid fixing the gauge from the beginning and the result thus obtained shows explicitly the gauge dependence of the Feynman propagator.

A linear RFQ ion trap for the Enriched Xenon Observatory - The design, construction, and performance of a linear radio-frequency ion trap (RFQ) intended for use in the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) are described. EXO aims to detect the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe to $^{136}$Ba. To suppress possible backgrounds EXO will complement the measurement of decay energy and, to some extent, topology of candidate events in a Xe filled detector with the identification of the daughter nucleus ($^{136}$Ba). The ion trap described here is capable of accepting, cooling, and confining individual Ba ions extracted from the site of the candidate double-beta decay event. A single trapped ion can then be identified, with a large signal-to-noise ratio, via laser spectroscopy.

How much entropy is produced in strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma (sQGP) by dissipative effects? - We argue that estimates of dissipative effects based on the first-order hydrodynamics with shear viscosity are potentially misleading because higher order terms in the gradient expansion of the dissipative part of the stress tensor tend to reduce them. Using recently obtained sound dispersion relation in thermal $\cal N$=4 supersymmetric plasma, we calculate the $resummed$ effect of these high order terms for Bjorken expansion appropriate to RHIC/LHC collisions. A reduction of entropy production is found to be substantial, up to an order of magnitude.

Spectral Analysis of the Chandra Comet Survey - We present results of the analysis of cometary X-ray spectra with an extended version of our charge exchange emission model (Bodewits et al. 2006). We have applied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyed comets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005 (Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations include a broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observational conditions. The interaction model is based on state selective, velocity dependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometary X-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind characteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly reflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra observations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Our analysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar wind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind, (II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with interplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of a fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.

Hamiltonian formalism in a problem of 3-th waves hierarchy - By the method of discrete transformation equations of 3-th wave hierarchy are constructed. We present in explicit form two Poisson structures, which allow to construct Hamiltonian operator consequent application of which leads to all equations of this hierarchy. For calculations it will be necessary results of previous paper \cite{1}, which for convenience of the reader we present in corresponding place of the text. The obtained formulae are checked by independent calculations.

Correlations, fluctuations and stability of a finite-size network of coupled oscillators - The incoherent state of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators exhibits marginal modes in mean field theory. We demonstrate that corrections due to finite size effects render these modes stable in the subcritical case, i.e. when the population is not synchronous. This demonstration is facilitated by the construction of a non-equilibrium statistical field theoretic formulation of a generic model of coupled oscillators. This theory is consistent with previous results. In the all-to-all case, the fluctuations in this theory are due completely to finite size corrections, which can be calculated in an expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of oscillators. The N -> infinity limit of this theory is what is traditionally called mean field theory for the Kuramoto model.

Route to Lambda in conformally coupled phantom cosmology - In this letter we investigate acceleration in the flat cosmological model with a conformally coupled phantom field and we show that acceleration is its generic feature. We reduce the dynamics of the model to a 3-dimensional dynamical system and analyze it on a invariant 2-dimensional submanifold. Then the concordance FRW model with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is a global attractor situated on a 2-dimensional invariant space. We also study the behaviour near this attractor, which can be approximated by the dynamics of the linearized part of the system. We demonstrate that trajectories of the conformally coupled phantom scalar field with a simple quadratic potential crosses the cosmological constant barrier infinitely many times in the phase space. The universal behaviour of the scalar field and its potential is also calculated. We conclude that the phantom scalar field conformally coupled to gravity gives a natural dynamical mechanism of concentration of the equation of state coefficient around the magical value $w_{\text{eff}}=-1$. We demonstrate route to Lambda through the infinite times crossing the $w_{\text{eff}}=-1$ phantom divide.

Interaction of Supernova Ejecta with Nearby Protoplanetary Disks - The early Solar System contained short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe (t1/2 = 1.5 Myr) whose most likely source was a nearby supernova. Previous models of Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis, that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1 pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.

Scaling cosmologies, geodesic motion and pseudo-susy - One-parameter solutions in supergravity carried by scalars and a metric trace out curves on the scalar manifold. In ungauged supergravity these curves describe a geodesic motion. It is known that a geodesic motion sometimes occurs in the presence of a scalar potential and for time-dependent solutions this can happen for scaling cosmologies. This note contains a further study of such solutions in the context of pseudo-supersymmetry for multi-field systems whose first-order equations we derive using a Bogomol'nyi-like method. In particular we show that scaling solutions that are pseudo-BPS must describe geodesic curves. Furthermore, we clarify how to solve the geodesic equations of motion when the scalar manifold is a maximally non-compact coset such as occurs in maximal supergravity. This relies upon a parametrization of the coset in the Borel gauge. We then illustrate this with the cosmological solutions of higher-dimensional gravity compactified on a $n$-torus.

The Peculiar Velocities of Local Type Ia Supernovae and their Impact on Cosmology - We quantify the effect of supernova Type Ia peculiar velocities on the derivation of cosmological parameters. The published distant and local Ia SNe used for the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report form the sample for this study. While previous work has assumed that the local SNe are at rest in the CMB frame (the No Flow assumption), we test this assumption by applying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different flow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, have varying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB frame. These datasets are then fit for w, Omega_m, and Omega_Lambda using flatness or LambdaCDM and a BAO prior. The chi^2 statistic is used to examine the effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. The most favored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly better than the No Flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocity studies. By comparing the No Flow assumption with the favored models we derive the largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiar velocities to be Delta w = +0.04. For Omega_Lambda, the potential error is Delta Omega_Lambda = -0.04 and for Omega_m, the potential error is Delta Omega_m < +0.01. The favored flow model (beta=0.5) produces the following cosmological parameters: w = -1.08 (+0.09,-0.08), Omega_m = 0.27 (+0.02,-0.02) assuming a flat cosmology, and Omega_Lambda = 0.80 (+0.08,-0.07) and Omega_m = 0.27 (+0.02,-0.02) for a w = -1 (LambdaCDM) cosmology.

Creation of Quark-gluon Plasma in Celestial Laboratories - It is shown that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as an ultrahigh energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to energies inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when the energy E of the particles comprising the matter in the black hole is $ \sim 10^{2} $ GeV or more,or equivalently the temperature T is $ \sim 10^{15}$ K or more, the entire matter in the black hole will be in the form of quark-gluon plasma permeated by leptons.

Temperature-driven transition from the Wigner Crystal to the Bond-Charge-Density Wave in the Quasi-One-Dimensional Quarter-Filled band - It is known that within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian for the one-dimensional 1/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal only if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a critical value. We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction is different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with increasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band quasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1 tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments strongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in several members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different antiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase diagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have either the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge occupancies. The spin-Peierls state is always a Bond-Charge-Density Wave.

Bubbling Surface Operators And S-Duality - We construct smooth asymptotically AdS_5xS^5 solutions of Type IIB supergravity corresponding to all the half-BPS surface operators in N=4 SYM. All the parameters labeling a half-BPS surface operator are identified in the corresponding bubbling geometry. We use the supergravity description of surface operators to study the action of the SL(2,Z) duality group of N=4 SYM on the parameters of the surface operator, and find that it coincides with the recent proposal by Gukov and Witten in the framework of the gauge theory approach to the geometrical Langlands with ramification. We also show that whenever a bubbling geometry becomes singular that the path integral description of the corresponding surface operator also becomes singular.

Resolving Cosmic Gamma Ray Anomalies with Dark Matter Decaying Now - Dark matter particles need not be completely stable, and in fact they may be decaying now. We consider this possibility in the frameworks of universal extra dimensions and supersymmetry with very late decays of WIMPs to Kaluza-Klein gravitons and gravitinos. The diffuse photon background is a sensitive probe, even for lifetimes far greater than the age of the Universe. Remarkably, both the energy spectrum and flux of the observed MeV gamma ray excess may be naturally explained by decaying dark matter with MeV mass splittings. Future observations of continuum and line photon fluxes will test this explanation and may provide novel constraints on cosmological parameters.

Neutrino-cooled accretion and GRB variability - For accretion rates Mdot~0.1 Msun/s to a few solar mass black hole the inner part of the disk is expected to make a transition from advection dominance to neutrino cooling. This transition is characterized by sharp changes of the disk properties. I argue here that during this transition, a modest increase of the accretion rate leads to powerful enhancement of the Poynting luminosity of the GRB flow and decrease of its baryon loading. These changes of the characteristics of the GRB flow translate into changing gamma-ray spectra from the photosphere of the flow. The photospheric interpretation of the GRB emission explains the observed narrowing of GRB pulses with increasing photon energy and the luminosity-spectral peak relation within and among bursts.

The VVDS type-1 AGN sample: The faint end of the luminosity function - In a previous paper (Gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) sample obtained from the first epoch data of the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN with redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their spectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity Function up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with previous results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our data, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us to constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By combining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted from the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different evolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the combined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived from the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the AGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the excess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we find, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that the peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift going to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of X-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of "AGN cosmic downsizing", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to more massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than that of low luminosity ones.

Can a Black Hole Collapse to a Space-time Singularity? - A critique of the singularity theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch is given. It is pointed out that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as an ultrahigh energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to energies inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when the energy $E$ of the particles comprising matter in a black hole is $\sim 10^{2} GeV$ or more, or equivalently, the temperature $T$ is $\sim 10^{15} K$ or more, the entire matter in the black hole is converted into quark-gluon plasma permeated by leptons. As quarks and leptons are fermions, it is emphasized that the collapse of a black-hole to a space-time singularity is inhibited by Pauli's exclusion principle. It is also suggested that ultimately a black hole may end up either as a stable quark star, or as a pulsating quark star which may be a source of gravitational radiation, or it may simply explode with a mini bang of a sort.

Right-Handed Quark Mixings in Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model with General CP Violation - We present a systematic approach to solve analytically for the right-handed quark mixings in the minimal left-right symmetric model which generally has both explicit and spontaneous CP violations. The leading-order result has the same hierarchical structure as the left-handed CKM mixing, but with additional CP phases originating from a spontaneous CP-violating phase in the Higgs vev. We explore the phenomenology entailed by the new right-handed mixing matrix, particularly the bounds on the mass of $W_R$ and the CP phase of the Higgs vev.

Dynamics of single polymers under extreme confinement - We study the dynamics of a single chain polymer confined to a two dimensional cell. We introduce a kinetically constrained lattice gas model that preserves the connectivity of the chain, and we use this kinetically constrained model to study the dynamics of the polymer at varying densities through Monte Carlo simulations. Even at densities close to the fully-packed configuration, we find that the monomers comprising the chain manage to diffuse around the box with a root mean square displacement of the order of the box dimensions over time scales for which the overall geometry of the polymer is, nevertheless, largely preserved. To capture this shape persistence, we define the local tangent field and study the two-time tangent-tangent correlation function, which exhibits a glass-like behavior. In both closed and open chains, we observe reptational motion and reshaping through local fingering events which entail global monomer displacement.

Diffuse Optical Light in Galaxy Clusters II: Correlations with Cluster Properties - We have measured the flux, profile, color, and substructure in the diffuse intracluster light (ICL) in a sample of ten galaxy clusters with a range of mass, morphology, redshift, and density. Deep, wide-field observations for this project were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Careful attention in reduction and analysis was paid to the illumination correction, background subtraction, point spread function determination, and galaxy subtraction. ICL flux is detected in both bands in all ten clusters ranging from 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar luminosities in r and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar luminosities in the B-band. These fluxes account for 6 to 22% of the total cluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the B-band. Average ICL B-r colors range from 1.5 to 2.8 mags when k and evolution corrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group environments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1} Mpc distant from the cluster center. Our sample, having been selected from the Abell sample, is incomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density, low flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high flux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations between ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do find that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally concentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is consistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or forming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.

Approach to Physical Reality: a note on Poincare Group and the philosophy of Nagarjuna - We argue about a possible scenario of physical reality based on the parallelism between Poincare group and the sunyata philosophy of Nagarjuna. The notion of "relational" is the common denominator of two views. We have approached the relational concept in third-person perspective (ontic level). It is possible to deduce different physical consequence and interpretation through first-person perspective approach. This relational interpretation leave open the questions: i)we must abandon the idea for a physical system the possibility to extract completeness information? ii)we must abandon the idea to infer a possible structure of physical reality?

Ultraviolet Observations of Supernovae - The motivations to make ultraviolet (UV) studies of supernovae (SNe) are reviewed and discussed in the light of the results obtained so far by means of IUE and HST observations. It appears that UV studies of SNe can, and do lead to fundamental results not only for our understanding of the SN phenomenon, such as the kinematics and the metallicity of the ejecta, but also for exciting new findings in Cosmology, such as the tantalizing evidence for "dark energy" that seems to pervade the Universe and to dominate its energetics. The need for additional and more detailed UV observations is also considered and discussed.

Stochastic fluctuations in metabolic pathways - Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks. Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked, and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently, fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks which are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for bioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.

A new search for planet transits in NGC 6791 - Context. Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the effects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution. Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched for close-in planets using the transit technique. Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\'artir telescope (2.1m), and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary transits was achieved. Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791 be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster. Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include: (i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii) limitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class telescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency of planets in NGC 6791.

Possible polarisation and spin dependent aspects of quantum gravity - We argue that quantum gravity theories that carry a Lie algebraic modification of the Poincare' and Heisenberg algebras inevitably provide inhomogeneities that may serve as seeds for cosmological structure formation. Furthermore, in this class of theories one must expect a strong polarisation and spin dependence of various quantum-gravity effects.

On the support genus of a contact structure - The algorithm given by Akbulut-Ozbagci constructs an explicit open book decomposition on a contact three-manifold described by a contact surgery on a link in the three-sphere. In this article, we will improve this algorithm by using Giroux's contact cell decomposition process. Our algorithm is more economical on choosing the supporting genus of the open book; in particular it gives a good upper bound for the recently defined ``minimal supporting genus invariant'' of contact structures.

Very Massive Stars in High-Redshift Galaxies - A significant fraction of Lyman Alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z> 5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. However only a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmitted through the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of the maximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass function. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya emission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters in which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results in a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation with a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift observations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the following eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with plausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star formation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5, v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at z=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the observed correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the observed anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very massive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the galaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate the presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop galaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.

Two center multipole expansion method: application to macromolecular systems - We propose a new theoretical method for the calculation of the interaction energy between macromolecular systems at large distances. The method provides a linear scaling of the computing time with the system size and is considered as an alternative to the well known fast multipole method. Its efficiency, accuracy and applicability to macromolecular systems is analyzed and discussed in detail.

Holographic formula for Q-curvature - This paper derives an explicit formula for Branson's Q-curvature in even-dimensional conformal geometry. The ingredients in the formula come from the Poincare metric in one higher dimension; hence the formula is called holographic. When specialized to the conformally flat case, the holographic formula expresses Q-curvature as a multiple of the Pfaffian and the divergence of a natural one-form. The paper also outlines the relation between holographic formulae for Q-curvature and a new theory of conformally covariant families of differential operators due to the second author.

The azimuth structure of nuclear collisions -- I - We describe azimuth structure commonly associated with elliptic and directed flow in the context of 2D angular autocorrelations for the purpose of precise separation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend the Fourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra and autocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze several examples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question the relevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2D angular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe a simulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflow using the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlation measure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitive measure of azimuth structure.

Exploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery - Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that require access to information resources currently rely on users manually discovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources -- often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking system del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources relevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for helping automate the resource discovery task.

Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr - The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding images on topics that are of interest to the user.

Resummed Cross Section for Jet Production at Hadron Colliders - We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the single-inclusive jet cross section at hadron colliders. The corrections we address arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction, when the incoming partons have just enough energy to produce the high-transverse-momentum final state. The structure of the resulting logarithmic corrections is known to depend crucially on the treatment of the invariant mass of the produced jet at threshold. We allow the jet to have a non-vanishing mass at threshold, which most closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results to available semi-analytical next-to-leading-order calculations, we derive resummed results valid to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We present numerical results for the resummation effects at Tevatron and RHIC energies.

Settling the Complexity of Computing Two-Player Nash Equilibria - We settle a long-standing open question in algorithmic game theory. We prove that Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game, is complete for the complexity class PPAD Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed version) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991. This is the first of a series of results concerning the complexity of Nash equilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems: Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time. The smoothed complexity of the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for Bimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in randomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest form of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are polynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have two broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations research: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix Linear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.

Equation of State in Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics: variable versus constant adiabatic index - The role of the equation of state for a perfectly conducting, relativistic magnetized fluid is the main subject of this work. The ideal constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of state on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This calls into question the validity of the constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across hydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative ones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits. Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a realistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when transitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these circumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the solution.

Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Field Emitting Diode: Understanding the System Response Based on Multiphysics Modeling - In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin film for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based modelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for degradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the device current history are reported.

Demographics of Transition Objects - The unusual properties of transition objects (young stars with an optically thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that significant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature of these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar accretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T Tauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy a restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically ~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger. These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri stars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of unity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.

Modeling the Field Emission Current Fluctuation in Carbon Nanotube Thin Films - Owing to their distinct properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising candidate for field emission devices. It has been found experimentally that the results related to the field emission performance show variability. The design of an efficient field emitting device requires the analysis of the variabilities with a systematic and multiphysics based modeling approach. In this paper, we develop a model of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin film by coupling the field emission phenomena, the electron-phonon transport and the mechanics of single isolated CNT. A computational scheme is developed by which the states of CNTs are updated in time incremental manner. The device current is calculated by using Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission to study the performance at the device scale.

Spectral averaging for trace compatible operators - In this note the notions of trace compatible operators and infinitesimal spectral flow are introduced. We define the spectral shift function as the integral of infinitesimal spectral flow. It is proved that the spectral shift function thus defined is absolutely continuous and Krein's formula is established. Some examples of trace compatible affine spaces of operators are given.

The molecular environment of massive star forming cores associated with Class II methanol maser emission - Methanol maser emission has proven to be an excellent signpost of regions undergoing massive star formation (MSF). To investigate their role as an evolutionary tracer, we have recently completed a large observing program with the ATCA to derive the dynamical and physical properties of molecular/ionised gas towards a sample of MSF regions traced by 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission. We find that the molecular gas in many of these regions breaks up into multiple sub-clumps which we separate into groups based on their association with/without methanol maser and cm continuum emission. The temperature and dynamic state of the molecular gas is markedly different between the groups. Based on these differences, we attempt to assess the evolutionary state of the cores in the groups and thus investigate the role of class II methanol masers as a tracer of MSF.

Gravitating Global k-monopole - A gravitating global k-monopole produces a tiny gravitational field outside the core in addition to a solid angular deficit in the k-field theory. As a new feature, the gravitational field can be attractive or repulsive depending on the non-canonical kinetic term.

Effect of atomic beam alignment on photon correlation measurements in cavity QED - Quantum trajectory simulations of a cavity QED system comprising an atomic beam traversing a standing-wave cavity are carried out. The delayed photon coincident rate for forwards scattering is computed and compared with the measurements of Rempe et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 1727 (1991)] and Foster et al. [Phys. Rev. A 61, 053821 (2000)]. It is shown that a moderate atomic beam misalignment can account for the degradation of the predicted correlation. Fits to the experimental data are made in the weak-field limit with a single adjustable parameter--the atomic beam tilt from perpendicular to the cavity axis. Departures of the measurement conditions from the weak-field limit are discussed.

Studies on optimizing potential energy functions for maximal intrinsic hyperpolarizability - We use numerical optimization to study the properties of (1) the class of one-dimensional potential energy functions and (2) systems of point charges in two-dimensions that yield the largest hyperpolarizabilities, which we find to be within 30% of the fundamental limit. We investigate the character of the potential energy functions and resulting wavefunctions and find that a broad range of potentials yield the same intrinsic hyperpolarizability ceiling of 0.709.

Critical test for Altshuler-Aronov theory: Evolution of the density of states singularity in double perovskite Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ with controlled disorder - With high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy measurements, the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level ($E_\mathrm{F}$) of double perovskite Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ having different degrees of Fe/Mo antisite disorder has been investigated with varying temperature. The DOS near $E_\mathrm{F}$ showed a systematic depletion with increasing degree of disorder, and recovered with increasing temperature. Altshuler-Aronov (AA) theory of disordered metals well explains the dependences of the experimental results. Scaling analysis of the spectra provides experimental indication for the functional form of the AA DOS singularity.

Some Properties of and Open Problems on Hessian Nilpotent Polynomials - In the recent progress [BE1], [M], [Z1] and [Z2], the well-known Jacobian conjecture ([BCW], [E]) has been reduced to a problem on HN (Hessian nilpotent) polynomials (the polynomials whose Hessian matrix are nilpotent) and their (deformed) inversion pairs. In this paper, we prove several results on HN polynomials, their (deformed) inversion pairs as well as the associated symmetric polynomial or formal maps. We also propose some open problems for further study of these objects.

Two Results on Homogeneous Hessian Nilpotent Polynomials - Let $z=(z_1, ..., z_n)$ and $\Delta=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac {\partial^2}{\partial z^2_i}$ the Laplace operator. A formal power series $P(z)$ is said to be {\it Hessian Nilpotent}(HN) if its Hessian matrix $\Hes P(z)=(\frac {\partial^2 P}{\partial z_i\partial z_j})$ is nilpotent. In recent developments in [BE1], [M] and [Z], the Jacobian conjecture has been reduced to the following so-called {\it vanishing conjecture}(VC) of HN polynomials: {\it for any homogeneous HN polynomial $P(z)$ $($of degree $d=4$$)$, we have $\Delta^m P^{m+1}(z)=0$ for any $m>>0$.} In this paper, we first show that, the VC holds for any homogeneous HN polynomial $P(z)$ provided that the projective subvarieties ${\mathcal Z}_P$ and ${\mathcal Z}_{\sigma_2}$ of $\mathbb C P^{n-1}$ determined by the principal ideals generated by $P(z)$ and $\sigma_2(z):=\sum_{i=1}^n z_i^2$, respectively, intersect only at regular points of ${\mathcal Z}_P$. Consequently, the Jacobian conjecture holds for the symmetric polynomial maps $F=z-\nabla P$ with $P(z)$ HN if $F$ has no non-zero fixed point $w\in \mathbb C^n$ with $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2=0$. Secondly, we show that the VC holds for a HN formal power series $P(z)$ if and only if, for any polynomial $f(z)$, $\Delta^m (f(z)P(z)^m)=0$ when $m>>0$.

A Vanishing Conjecture on Differential Operators with Constant Coefficients - In the recent progress [BE1], [Me] and [Z2], the well-known JC (Jacobian conjecture) ([BCW], [E]) has been reduced to a VC (vanishing conjecture) on the Laplace operators and HN (Hessian nilpotent) polynomials (the polynomials whose Hessian matrix are nilpotent). In this paper, we first show that the vanishing conjecture above, hence also the JC, is equivalent to a vanishing conjecture for all 2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials $P$ (the polynomials $P(z)$ satisfying $\Lambda^m P^m=0$ for all $m\ge 1$). We then transform some results in the literature on the JC, HN polynomials and the VC of the Laplace operators to certain results on $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials and the associated VC for 2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$. This part of the paper can also be read as a short survey on HN polynomials and the associated VC in the more general setting. Finally, we discuss a still-to-be-understood connection of $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials in general with the classical orthogonal polynomials in one or more variables. This connection provides a conceptual understanding for the isotropic properties of homogeneous $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials for the 2nd order homogeneous full rank differential operators $\Lambda$ with constant coefficients.

Effects of accelerating growth on the evolution of weighted complex networks - Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks. Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical simulations.

N_p N_n Scheme Based on New Empirical Formula for Excitation Energy - We examine the $N_p N_n$ scheme based on a recently proposed simple empirical formula which is highly valid for the excitation energy of the first excited natural parity even multipole states in even-even nuclei. We demonstrate explicitly that the $N_p N_n$ scheme for the excitation energy emerges from the separate exponential dependence of the excitation energy on the valence nucleon numbers $N_p$ and $N_n$ together with the fact that only a limited set of numbers is allowed for the $N_p$ and $N_n$ of the existing nuclei.

Locally Decodable Codes From Nice Subsets of Finite Fields and Prime Factors of Mersenne Numbers - A k-query Locally Decodable Code (LDC) encodes an n-bit message x as an N-bit codeword C(x), such that one can probabilistically recover any bit x_i of the message by querying only k bits of the codeword C(x), even after some constant fraction of codeword bits has been corrupted. The major goal of LDC related research is to establish the optimal trade-off between length and query complexity of such codes. Recently [Y] introduced a novel technique for constructing locally decodable codes and vastly improved the upper bounds for code length. The technique is based on Mersenne primes. In this paper we extend the work of [Y] and argue that further progress via these methods is tied to progress on an old number theory question regarding the size of the largest prime factors of Mersenne numbers. Specifically, we show that every Mersenne number m=2^t-1 that has a prime factor p>m^\gamma yields a family of k(\gamma)-query locally decodable codes of length Exp(n^{1/t}). Conversely, if for some fixed k and all \epsilon > 0 one can use the technique of [Y] to obtain a family of k-query LDCs of length Exp(n^\epsilon); then infinitely many Mersenne numbers have prime factors arger than known currently.

Pair production with neutrinos in an intense background magnetic field - We present a detailed calculation of the electron-positron production rate using neutrinos in an intense background magnetic field. The computation is done for the process nu -> nu e- e+ (where nu can be nu_e, nu_mu, or nu_tau) within the framework of the Standard Model. Results are given for various combinations of Landau-levels over a range of possible incoming neutrino energies and magnetic field strengths.

Theoretical Aspects of the SOM Algorithm - The SOM algorithm is very astonishing. On the one hand, it is very simple to write down and to simulate, its practical properties are clear and easy to observe. But, on the other hand, its theoretical properties still remain without proof in the general case, despite the great efforts of several authors. In this paper, we pass in review the last results and provide some conjectures for the future work.

Effect of the Spatial Dispersion on the Shape of a Light Pulse in a Quantum Well - Reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of a symmetric light pulse, the carrying frequency of which is close to the frequency of interband transitions in a quantum well, are calculated. Energy levels of the quantum well are assumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken into account. A wide quantum well (the width of which is comparable to the length of the light wave, corresponding to the pulse carrying frequency) is considered, and the dependance of the interband matrix element of the momentum operator on the light wave vector is taken into account. Refractive indices of barriers and quantum well are assumed equal each other. The problem is solved for an arbitrary ratio of radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excitations. It is shown that the spatial dispersion essentially affects the shapes of reflected and transmitted pulses. The largest changes occur when the radiative broadening is close to the difference of frequencies of interband transitions taken into account.

The origin of the anomalously strong influence of out-of-plane disorder on high-Tc superconductivity - The electronic structure of Bi2Sr2-xRxCuOy(R=La, Eu) near the (pi,0) point of the first Brillouin zone was studied by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The temperature T* above which the pseudogap structure in the ARPES spectrum disappears was found to have an R dependence that is opposite to that ofthe superconducting transition temperature Tc. This indicates that the pseudogap state is competing with high-Tc superconductivity, and the large Tc suppression observed with increasing the out-of-plane disorder is due to the stabilization of the pseudogap state.

Relativistic Hydrodynamics at RHIC and LHC - Recent development of a hydrodynamic model is discussed by putting an emphasis on realistic treatment of the early and late stages in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The model, which incorporates a hydrodynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma with a kinetic approach of hadron cascades, is applied to analysis of elliptic flow data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energy. It is predicted that the elliptic flow parameter based on the hybrid model increases with the collision energy up to the Large Hadron Collider energy.

Retract rationality and Noether's problem - Let K be any field and G be a finite group. We will prove that, if K is any field, p an odd prime number, and G is a non-abelian group of exponent p with |G|=p^3 or p^4 satisfying [K(\zeta_p):K] <= 2, then K(G) is rational over K. We will also show that K(G) is retract rational if G belongs to a much larger class of p-groups. In particular, generic G-polynomials of G-Galois extensions exist for these groups.

Noether's problem for some p-groups - Let K be any field and G be a finite group. Noether's problem asks whether the fixed field is rational (=purely transcendental) over K. We will prove that if G is a non-abelian p-group of order p^n containing a cyclic subgroup of index p and K is any field containing a primitive p^{n-2}-th root of unity, then K(G) is rational over K.

The canonical volume of threefolds of general type with $\chi<1$ - We prove that the canonical volume $K^3\geq {1/30}$ for all projective 3-folds of general type with $\chi(\mathcal{O})\leq 0$. This bound is sharp.

Very High Energy Gamma Rays from Supernova Remnants and Constraints on the Galactic Interstellar Radiation Field - The large-scale Galactic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) is the result of stellar emission and dust re-processing of starlight. Where the energy density of the ISRF is high (e.g., the Galactic Centre), the dominant gamma-ray emission in individual supernova remnants (SNRs), such as G0.9+0.1, may come from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the ISRF. Several models of the ISRF exist. The most recent one, which has been calculated by us, predicts a significantly higher ISRF than the well-used model of Mathis, Mezger, and Panagia. However,comparison with data is limited to local observations. Based on our current estimate of the ISRF we predict the gamma-ray emission in the SNRs G0.9+0.1 and RXJ1713, and pair-production absorption features above 20 TeV in the spectra of G0.9+0.1, J1713-381, and J1634-472. We discuss how GLAST, along with current and future very high energy instruments, may be able to provide upper bounds on the large-scale ISRF.

Magneto-oscillations due to electron-electron interactions in the ac conductivity of a 2D electron gas - Electron-electron interactions give rise to the correction, \delta\sigma^{int}(\omega), to the ac magnetoconductivity, \sigma(\omega), of a clean 2D electron gas that is periodic in \omega_c^{-1}, where \omega_c is the cyclotron frequency. Unlike conventional harmonics of the cyclotron resonance, which are periodic with \omega, this correction is periodic with \omega^{3/2}. Oscillations in \delta\sigma^{int}(\omega) develop at low magnetic fields, \omega_c\ll\omega, when the conventional harmonics are suppressed by the disorder. Their origin is a {\em double} backscattering of an electron from the impurity-induced Friedel oscillations. During the time \sim\omega^{-1} between the two backscattering events the electron travels only a {\em small portion} of the Larmour circle.

Optimal fluctuation approach to a directed polymer in a random medium - A modification of the optimal fluctuation approach is applied to study the tails of the free energy distribution function P(F) for an elastic string in quenched disorder both in the regions of the universal behavior of P(F) and in the regions of large fluctuations, where the behavior of P(F) is non-universal. The difference between the two regimes is shown to consist in whether it is necessary or not to take into account the renormalization of parameters by the fluctuations of disorder in the vicinity of the optimal fluctuation.

Implementation of a Gauss convoluted Pandel PDF for track reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes - A probability distribution function is presented which provides a realistic description of the detection of scattered photons. The resulting probabilities can be described analytically by means of a superposition of several special functions. These exact expressions can be evaluated numerically only for small distances and limited time residuals, due to computer accuracy limitations. In this report we provide approximations for the exact expressions in different regions of the distance-time residual space, defined by the detector geometry and the space-time scale of an event. These approximations can be evaluated numerically with a relative error with respect to the exact expression at the boundaries of less than 0.001.

A Cut-free Sequent Calculus for Bi-Intuitionistic Logic: Extended Version - Bi-intuitionistic logic is the extension of intuitionistic logic with a connective dual to implication. Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by Rauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her subsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by Uustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for BiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics. Ensuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and its dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus handles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from premises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed derivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be used for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.

From virtual work principle to least action principle for stochastic dynamics - After the justification of the maximum entropy principle for equilibrium mechanical system from the principle of virtual work, i.e., the virtual work of microscopic forces on the elements of a mechanical system vanishes in thermodynamic equilibrium, we present in this paper an application of the same principle to dynamical systems out of equilibrium. The aim of this work is to justify a least action principle and the concurrent maximum path entropy principle for nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems.

Traitement Des Donnees Manquantes Au Moyen De L'Algorithme De Kohonen - Nous montrons comment il est possible d'utiliser l'algorithme d'auto organisation de Kohonen pour traiter des donn\'ees avec valeurs manquantes et estimer ces derni\`eres. Apr\`es un rappel m\'ethodologique, nous illustrons notre propos \`a partir de trois applications \`a des donn\'ees r\'eelles. ----- We show how it is possible to use the Kohonen self-organizing algorithm to deal with data which contain missing values and to estimate them. After a methodological recall, we illustrate our purpose from three real databases applications.

Further Analysis of Excitations of Quarks at Finite Temperature -- Mass Effect and Pole Structure -- - We calculate the spectral function of the massive quark at finite temperature (T) using a Yukawa model and show that the peak in the negative energy region among the three-peaks found in a previous work for the massless quark is largely suppressed. To explore the underlying mechanism of this behavior, we also investigate the pole structure of the retarded Green function of the quark. We will show the result only for the massless quark. We find the residues of the poles corresponding the three-peaks are all comparable at $T\sim m_b$. We also show that the multi-peak structure of the quark spectra is well described in the pole approximation which indicates that the quasi-paricle picture is valid in this $T$ region.

Dynamical Equilibrium, trajectories study in an economical system. The case of the labor market - The paper deals with the study of labor market dynamics, and aims to characterize its equilibriums and possible trajectories. The theoretical background is the theory of the segmented labor market. The main idea is that this theory is well adapted to interpret the observed trajectories, due to the heterogeneity of the work situations.

Borromean Entanglement Revisited - An interesting analogy between quantum entangled states and topological links was suggested by Aravind. In particular, he emphasized a connection between the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and the Borromean rings. However, he made the connection in a way that depends on the choice of measurement basis. We reconsider it in a basis-independent way by using the reduced density matrix.

An SiO Maser Search off the Galactic Plane - We have searched for the SiO J=1--0 v= 1 and 2 maser lines at ~ 43 GHz in 277 2MASS/MSX/IRAS sources off the Galactic plane (|b|> 3 deg), which resulted in 119 (112 new) detections. Among the new detections, are two very faint objects with MSX 12 micron flux densities below 2 Jy. These are likely to be O-rich AGB-stars associated with dwarf-galaxy tidal tails. The sample also includes medium bright MSX objects at moderately high Galactic latitudes (3 deg<|b|<5 deg) and in the IRAS gap at higher latitudes. A signature of a warp of the inner Galactic disk is found for a disk subsample. This warp appears relatively strongly in the area of 0<l<45 deg and 3<|b|<5 deg. We also found a group of stars that does not follow to the Galactic rotation. This feature appears in the Galactic disk at l~ 27 deg, and extends more than 15 deg in Galactic latitude, like a stream of tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy.

Dislocation Dynamics in a Crystal Lattice (Peierls-Nabarro) Relief - The theory of the dislocation motion in the periodic potential relief of the crystal lattice (the Peierls-Nabarro barriers) is reviewed. On the basis of the kink mechanism the temperature dependence of the flow stress is described for a wide class of materials. The theory of quantum mechanical dislocation tunnelling through the Peierls-Nabarro barriers is extended and compared with experimental data on the plasticity of alkali halides, BCC and HCP metals at low temperatures. The behavior of the flow stress at the range of athermic anomalies is modeled by changing the mechanism of the dislocation motion from the thermally activated hopping over the barriers to the quantum tunnelling through them. Some results of previous calculations are represented in a more explicit convenient for applications form. The pronounced effect of the switching between the normal and the superconducting states on the flow stress of metals is explained on the basis of the change in the dissipative properties of the electron subsystem affecting the dislocation motion.

Spectrum of cosmic rays, produced in supernova remnants - Nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants is employed to calculate CR spectra. The magnetic field in SNRs is assumed to be significantly amplified by the efficiently accelerating nuclear CR component. It is shown that the calculated CR spectra agree in a satisfactory way with the existing measurements up to the energy $10^{17}$ eV. The power law spectrum of protons extends up to the energy $3\times 10^{15}$ eV with a subsequent exponential cutoff. It gives a natural explanation for the observed knee in the Galactic CR spectrum. The maximum energy of the accelerated nuclei is proportional to their charge number $Z$. Therefore the break in the Galactic CR spectrum is the result of the contribution of progressively heavier species in the overall CR spectrum so that at $10^{17}$ eV the CR spectrum is dominated by iron group nuclei. It is shown that this component plus a suitably chosen extragalactic CR component can give a consistent description for the entire Galactic CR spectrum.

One-parameter families of functions in the Pick class - In the one-parameter family of power-law maps of the form $f_a(x)=-|x|^{\alpha}+a,$ $\alpha >1,$ we give examples of mutually related dynamically determined quantities, depending on the parameter $a$, such that one is a Pick function of the following one. These Pick functions are extendable by reflection through the $(1,+\infty)$ half-axis and have completely monotone derivatives there.

The homology of the Steinberg variety and Weyl group coinvariants - Let G be a complex, connected, reductive algebraic group with Weyl group W and Steinberg variety Z. We show that the graded Borel-Moore homology of Z is isomorphic to the smash product of the coinvariant algebra of W and the group algebra of W.

Spin-spin Correlation in Some Excited States of Transverse Ising Model - We consider the transverse Ising model in one dimension with nearest-neighbour interaction and calculate exactly the longitudinal spin-spin correlation for a class of excited states. These states are known to play an important role in the perturbative treatment of one-dimensional transverse Ising model with frustrated second-neighbour interaction. To calculate the correlation, we follow the earlier procedure of Wu, use Szego's theorem and also use Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. The result is that the correlation decays algebraically with distance ($n$) as $1/\surd n$ and is oscillatory or non-oscillatory depending on the magnitude of the transverse field.

Radiative quarkonium decays and the NMSSM Higgs interpretation of the HyperCP Sigma+ --> p mu+mu- events - We study the potential of radiative decays of the Upsilon(1S) and of the phi mesons to search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson, proposed as a possible interpretation of Sigma+ --> p mu+mu- events observed by the HyperCP collaboration at Fermilab. We conclude that the detection of this signal should certainly be possible with the current CLEO Upsilon(1S) data, and is within the reach of KLOE in at least part of the range of couplings suggested by the HyperCP findings.

A resummed perturbative estimate for the quarkonium spectral function in hot QCD - By making use of the finite-temperature real-time static potential that was introduced and computed to leading non-trivial order in Hard Thermal Loop resummed perturbation theory in recent work, and solving numerically a Schr\"odinger-type equation, we estimate the quarkonium (in practice, bottomonium) contribution to the spectral function of the electromagnetic current in hot QCD. The spectral function shows a single resonance peak which becomes wider and then disappears as the temperature is increased beyond 450 MeV or so. This behaviour can be compared with recently attempted lattice reconstructions of the same quantity, based on the ``maximum entropy method'', which generically show several peaks. We also specify the dependence of our results on the spatial momentum of the electromagnetic current, as well as on the baryon chemical potential characterising the hot QCD plasma.

An Exotic Approach to Hadron Physics - An exotic approach to hadrons is discussed. It is based on the recently developed open-closed string duality explicitly conjectured as the AdS/CFT correspondence. Mesons as well as pentaquarks are studied in this approach. Spins are introduced as distribution functions over the string, and a second quantization method of string theory is examined and used to estimate the mass and decay width of various hadrons. This approach provides a way to understand the structure of flavor by a configuration of probe branes.

Fermi Surface Reconstruction without Breakdown of Kondo Screening at Quantum Critical Point - Motivated by recent Hall-effect experiment in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, we study ground state properties of a Kondo lattice model in a two-dimensional square lattice using variational Monte Carlo method. We show that there are two types of phase transition, antiferromagnetic transition and topological one (Fermi surface reconstruction). In a wide region of parameters, these two transitions occur simultaneously without the breakdown of Kondo screening, accompanied by a discontinuous change of the Hall coefficient. This result is consistent with the experiment and gives a novel theoretical picture for the quantum critical point in heavy fermion systems.

A User-Friendly Code to Diagnose Chromospheric Plasmas - The physical interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations of lines of neutral helium, such as those of the 10830 A multiplet, represents an excellent opportunity for investigating the magnetism of plasma structures in the solar chromosphere. Here we present a powerful forward modeling and inversion code that permits either to calculate the emergent intensity and polarization for any given magnetic field vector or to infer the dynamical and magnetic properties from the observed Stokes profiles. This diagnostic tool is based on the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which self-consistently accounts for the Hanle and Zeeman effects in the most general case of the incomplete Paschen-Back effect regime. We also take into account radiative transfer effects. An efficient numerical scheme based on global optimization methods has been applied. Our Stokes inversion code permits a fast and reliable determination of the global minimum.

Inhomogeneous color superconductivity and the cooling of compact stars - In this talk I discuss the inhomogeneous (LOFF) color superconductive phases of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In particular, I show the effect of a core of LOFF phase on the cooling of a compact star.

Scaling anomaly in cosmic string background - We show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic string background is broken upon inequivalent quantization of the classical system, leading to anomaly. The consequence of this anomaly is the formation of single bound state in the coupling interval \gamma\in(-1,1). The inequivalent quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension parameter \omega. It has been conjectured that the formation of loosely bound state in cosmic string background may lead to the so called anomalous scattering cross section for the particles, which is usually seen in molecular physics.

On de Broglie's quantum particle as the soliton solution of linear Schr\"odinger equation - We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\"odinger equation without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass.

Stringy corrections to a time-dependent background solution of string and M-Theory - We consider one of the simplest time-dependent backgrounds in M-theory, describing the shrinking away of the M-theory dimension with the other spatial dimensions static. As the M-theory dimension becomes small, the situation becomes well-described by string theory in a singular cosmological background where the string coupling tends to zero but the $\alpha'$-corrections become large, near the cosmic singularity. We compute these $\alpha'$-corrections, both for the background and for linearized perturbations, in heterotic string theory, and show they may be reproduced by a map from eleven-dimensional M-theory.

Doubly Special Relativity and Finsler geometry - We discuss the recent proposal of implementing Doubly Special Relativity in configuration space by means of Finsler geometry. Although this formalism leads to a consistent description of the dynamics of a particle, it does not seem to give a complete description of the physics. In particular, the Finsler line element is not invariant under the deformed Lorentz transformations of Doubly Special Relativity. We study in detail some simple applications of the formalism.

The Sedentary Survey of Extreme High Energy Peaked BL Lacs III. Results from Optical Spectroscopy - The multi-frequency Sedentary Survey is a flux limited, statistically well-defined sample of highly X-ray dominated BL Lacertae objects (HBLs) which includes 150 sources. In this paper, the third of the series, we report the results of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified objects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical telescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources, 50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL Lacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad emission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used to build the survey is highly efficient (about 90%) in selecting BL Lacs objects. We present positional and spectroscopic information for all confirmed BL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50 new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift distribution of the complete sample is presented and compared with that of other BL Lacs samples. For 26 sources without recognizable absorption features, we calculated lower limits to the redshift using a method based on simulated optical spectra with different ratios between jet and galaxy emission. For a subsample of 38 object with high-quality spectra, we find a correlation between the optical spectral slope, the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, and the Ca H&K break value, indicating that for powerful/beamed sources the optical light is dominated by the non-thermal emission from the jet.

Latin bitrades derived from groups - A latin bitrade is a pair of partial latin squares which are disjoint, occupy the same set of non-empty cells, and whose corresponding rows and columns contain the same set of entries. Dr\'apal (\cite{Dr9}) showed that a latin bitrade is equivalent to three derangements whose product is the identity and whose cycles pairwise have at most one point in common. By letting a group act on itself by right translation, we show how some latin bitrades may be derived from groups without specifying an independent group action. Properties of latin trades such as homogeneousness, minimality (via thinness) and orthogonality may also be encoded succinctly within the group structure. We apply the construction to some well-known groups, constructing previously unknown latin bitrades. In particular, we show the existence of minimal, $k$-homogeneous latin trades for each odd $k\geq 3$. In some cases these are the smallest known such examples.

Wormholes in the accelerating universe - We discuss different arguments that have been raised against the viability of the big trip process, reaching the conclusions that this process can actually occur by accretion of phantom energy onto the wormholes and that it is stable and might occur in the global context of a multiverse model. We finally argue that the big trip does not contradict any holographic bounds on entropy and information.

Spheroidal and torsional modes of quasistatic shear oscillations in the solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics - The past three decades of investigation on nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics have seen gradual recognition that elastodynamic approach to the continuum mechanics of nuclear matter provides proper account of macroscopic motions of degenerate Fermi-matter constituting interior of the nuclear material objects, the densest of all known today. This paper focuses on one theoretical issue of this development which is concerned with oscillatory behavior of a viscoelastic solid globe in the regime of quasistatic, force-free, non-compressional oscillations less investigated in the literature compared to oscillations in the regime of standing shear waves. We show that in this case the problem of computing frequency and lifetime of spheroidal and torsional modes of non-radial shear vibrations damped by viscosity can be unambiguously resolved by working from the energy balance equation and taking advantage of the Rayleigh's variational method. The efficiency of this method is demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics dealing with oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic Fermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density, the shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.

Extra force in $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity - The equation of motion for test particles in $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity is derived. By considering an explicit coupling between an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature, $R$, and the Lagrangian density of matter, it is shown that an extra force arises. This extra force is orthogonal to the four-velocity and the corresponding acceleration law is obtained in the weak field limit. Connections with MOND and with the Pioneer anomaly are further discussed.

Averaging and Cosmological Observations - The gravitational field equations on cosmological scales are obtained by averaging the Einstein field equations of general relativity. By assuming spatial homogeneity and isotropy on the largest scales, the local inhomogeneities affect the dynamics though correction (backreaction) terms, which can lead to behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively different from the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker models. The effects of averaging on cosmological observations are discussed. It is argued that, based on estimates from observational data, the backreaction (and, in particular, the averaged spatial curvature) can have a very significant dynamical effect on the evolution of the Universe and must be taken into account in observational cosmology.

Calorimetry of Bose-Einstein condensates - We outline a practical scheme for measuring the thermodynamic properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of internal energy. We propose using Bragg scattering and controlled trap manipulations to impart a precise amount of energy to a near zero temperature condensate. After thermalisation the temperature can be measured using standard techniques to determine the state equation $T(U,N,\omega)$. Our analysis accounts for interaction effects and the excitation of constants of motion which restrict the energy available for thermalisation.

Parallelizing Quantum Circuits - We present a novel automated technique for parallelizing quantum circuits via forward and backward translation to measurement-based quantum computing patterns and analyze the trade off in terms of depth and space complexity. As a result we distinguish a class of polynomial depth circuits that can be parallelized to logarithmic depth while adding only polynomial many auxiliary qubits. In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits. Furthermore, we prove a logarithmic separation in terms of quantum depth between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based model.

Quantum memory for images - a quantum hologram - Matter-light quantum interface and quantum memory for light are important ingredients of quantum information protocols, such as quantum networks, distributed quantum computation, etc. In this Letter we present a spatially multimode scheme for quantum memory for light, which we call a quantum hologram. Our approach uses a multi-atom ensemble which has been shown to be efficient for a single spatial mode quantum memory. Due to the multi-atom nature of the ensemble it is capable of storing many spatial modes, a feature critical for the present proposal. A quantum hologram has a higher storage capacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum features of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantum states, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve. Due to optical parallelism, the information capacity of the quantum hologram will obviously exceed that of a single-mode scheme.

Financial time-series analysis: A brief overview - Prices of commodities or assets produce what is called time-series. Different kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades. Nowadays, all transactions on a financial market are recorded, leading to a huge amount of data available, either for free in the Internet or commercially. Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as to theoreticians, for making inferences and predictions. Furthermore, the stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to economists, but also to statisticians and physicists. While it would be a formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic, with this review we try to give a flavor of some of its aspects.

Integral representations for solutions of exponential Gauss-Manin systems - Let f,g be two algebraically independent regular functions from the smooth affine complex variety U to the affine line. The associated exponential Gauss-Manin systems on the affine line are defined to be the cohomology sheaves of the direct image of the exponential differential system $\mathcal{O}_U e^g $ with respect to f. We prove that its holomorphic solutions admit representations in terms of period integrals over topological chains with possibly closed support and with rapid decay condition.

Charged current deep-inelastic scattering at three loops - We derive for deep-inelastic neutrino-proton scattering in the combination nu P - nubar P the perturbative QCD corrections to three loops for the charged current structure functions F_2, F_L and F_3. In leading twist approximation we calculate the first five odd-integer Mellin moments in the case of F_2 and F_L and the first five even-integer moments in the case of F_3. As a new result we obtain the coefficient functions to O(alpha_s^3) while the corresponding anomalous dimensions agree with known results in the literature.

Detection of a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588 - We have observed the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). In this manuscript we report the discovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The kilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single trial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency have only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency is higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly suggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in LMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the highest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc from a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent flux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of the weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The root-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this is the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general anti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz QPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a colour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further evidence for the atoll nature of the source.

Surface gap solitons at a nonlinearity interface - We demonstrate existence of waves localized at the interface of two nonlinear periodic media with different coefficients of the cubic nonlinearity via the one-dimensional Gross--Pitaevsky equation. We call these waves the surface gap solitons (SGS). In the case of smooth symmetric periodic potentials, we study analytically bifurcations of SGS's from standard gap solitons and determine numerically the maximal jump of the nonlinearity coefficient allowing for the SGS existence. We show that the maximal jump vanishes near the thresholds of bifurcations of gap solitons. In the case of continuous potentials with a jump in the first derivative at the interface, we develop a homotopy method of continuation of SGS families from the solution obtained via gluing of parts of the standard gap solitons and study existence of SGS's in the photonic band gaps. We explain the termination of the SGS families in the interior points of the band gaps from the bifurcation of linear bound states in the continuous non-smooth potentials.

A Catalogue of Morphologically Classified Galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: North Equatorial Region - We present a catalogue of morphologically classified bright galaxies in the north equatorial stripe (230 deg$^2$) derived from the Third Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Morphological classification is performed by visual inspection of images in the $g$ band. The catalogue contains 2253 galaxies complete to a magnitude limit of $r=16$ after Galactic extinction correction, selected from 2658 objects that are judged as extended in the photometric catalogue in the same magnitude limit. 1866 galaxies in our catalogue have spectroscopic information. A brief statistical analysis is presented for the frequency of morphological types and mean colours in the catalogue. A visual inspection of the images reveals that the rate of interacting galaxies in the local Universe is approximately 1.5% in the $r\le16$ sample. A verification is made for the photometric catalogue generated by the SDSS, especially as to its bright end completeness.

Blazar surveys with WMAP and Swift - We present the preliminary results from two new surveys of blazars that have direct implications on the GLAST detection of extragalactic sources from two different perspectives: microwave selection and a combined deep X-ray/radio selection. The first one is a 41 GHz flux-limited sample extracted from the WMAP 3-yr catalog of microwave point sources. This is a statistically well defined sample of about 200 blazars and radio galaxies, most of which are expected to be detected by GLAST. The second one is a new deep survey of Blazars selected among the radio sources that are spatially coincident with serendipitous sources detected in deep X-ray images (0.3-10 keV) centered on the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) discovered by the Swift satellite. This sample is particularly interesting from a statistical viewpoint since a) it is unbiased as GRBs explode at random positions in the sky, b) it is very deep in the X-ray band (\fx \simgt $10^{-15}$ \ergs) with a position accuracy of a few arc-seconds, c) it will cover a fairly large (20-30 square deg.) area of sky, d) it includes all blazars with radio flux (1.4 GHz) larger than 10 mJy, making it approximately two orders of magnitude deeper than the WMAP sample and about one order of magnitude deeper than the deepest existing complete samples of radio selected blazars, and e) it can be used to estimate the amount of unresolved GLAST high latitude gamma-ray background and its anisotropy spectrum.

I. The mass gap and solution of the quark confinement problem in QCD - Using the previously derived confining gluon propagator, the corresponding system of equations determining the quark propagator is derived. The system of equations consists of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark propagator itself, which includes the zero momentum transfer quark-gluon vertex. It is complemented by the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this vertex. The quark equation depends explicitly on the mass gap, determining the scale of the truly nonperturbative dynamics in the QCD ground state. The obtained system of equations is manifestly gauge-invariant, i.e., does not depend explicitly on the gauge-fixing parameter. It is also free from all the types of the perturbative contributions ("contaminations"), which may appear at the fundamental quark-gluon level.

Tunnelling from black holes and tunnelling into white holes - Hawking radiation is nowadays being understood as tunnelling through black hole horizons. Here, the extension of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to tunnelling for non-rotating and rotating black holes in different non-singular coordinate systems not only confirms this quantum emission from black holes but also reveals the new phenomenon of absorption into white holes by quantum mechanical tunnelling. The role of a boundary condition of total absorption or emission is also clarified.

Solving algebraic equations in roots of unity - This paper is devoted to finding solutions of polynomial equations in roots of unity. It was conjectured by S. Lang and proved by M. Laurent that all such solutions can be described in terms of a finite number of parametric families called maximal torsion cosets. We obtain new explicit upper bounds for the number of maximal torsion cosets on an algebraic subvariety of the complex algebraic $n$-torus ${\mathbb G}_{\rm m}^n$. In contrast to earlier works that give the bounds of polynomial growth in the maximum total degree of defining polynomials, the proofs of our results are constructive. This allows us to obtain a new algorithm for determining maximal torsion cosets on an algebraic subvariety of ${\mathbb G}_{\rm m}^n$.

Self-Organization applied to Dynamic Network Layout - As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a strong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for "attractive and repulsive forces". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with several application examples from on going complex systems research.

VIMOS total transmission profiles for broad-band filters - VIMOS is a wide-field imager and spectrograph mounted on UT3 at the VLT, whose FOV consists of four 7'x8' quadrants. Here we present the measurements of total transmission profiles -- i.e. the throughput of telescope + instrument -- for the broad band filters U, B, V, R, I, and z for each of its four quadrants. Those measurements can also be downloaded from the public VIMOS web-page. The transmission profiles are compared with previous estimates from the VIMOS consortium.

Searches for Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies in Galaxy Groups - We present the results of a search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in six different galaxy groups: Dorado, NGC1400, NGC0681, NGC4038, NGC4697 and NGC5084. We searched in the apparent magnitude range 17.5 < b_j < 20.5 (except NGC5084: 19.2 < b_j < 21.0). We found 1 definite plus 2 possible UCD candidates in the Dorado group and 2 possible UCD candidates in the NGC1400 group. No UCDs were found in the other groups. We compared these results with predicted luminosities of UCDs in the groups according to the hypothesis that UCDs are globular clusters formed in galaxies. The theoretical predictions broadly agree with the observational results, but deeper surveys are needed to fully test the predictions.

Information Theoretic Proofs of Entropy Power Inequalities - While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\'u used in earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's covariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy power.

Van der Waals interaction between a microparticle and a single-wall carbon nanotube - The Lifshitz-type formulas describing the free energy and the force of the van der Waals interaction between an atom (molecule) and a single-wall carbon nanotube are obtained. The single-wall nanotube is considered as a cylindrical sheet carrying a two-dimensional free electron gas with appropriate boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field. The obtained formulas are used to calculate the van der Waals free energy and force between a hydrogen atom (molecule) and single-wall carbon nanotubes of different radia. Comparison studies of the van der Waals interaction of hydrogen atoms with single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes show that depending on atom-nanotube separation distance the idealization of graphite dielectric permittivity is already applicable to nanotubes with only two or three walls.

Relativistic corrections for two- and three-body flux tube model - We generalize the relativistic flux tube model for arbitrary two- or three-body systems. The spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions of the flux tube to the total Hamiltonian are computed in perturbation. In particular, we show that the spin-dependent part exhibits a universal spin-orbit form: It does not depend on the nature of the confined particles. The general equations we present, being well-defined for light particles, can thus be applied to usual as well as exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons and glueballs.

The No-Broadcasting Theorem and its Classical Counterpart - Although it is widely accepted that `no-broadcasting' -- the nonclonability of quantum information -- is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, an impossibility theorem for the broadcasting of general density matrices has not yet been formulated. In this paper, we present a general proof for the no-broadcasting theorem, which applies to arbitrary density matrices. The proof relies on entropic considerations, and as such can also be directly linked to its classical counterpart, which applies to probabilistic distributions of statistical ensembles.

Quantum random walks and vanishing of the second Hochschild cohomology - Given a conditionally completely positive map $\mathcal L$ on a unital $\ast$-algebra $\A$, we find an interesting connection between the second Hochschild cohomology of $\A$ with coefficients in the bimodule $E_{\mathcal L}=\B^a(\A \oplus M)$ of adjointable maps, where $M$ is the GNS bimodule of $\mathcal L$, and the possibility of constructing a quantum random walk (in the sense of \cite{AP,LP,L,KBS}) corresponding to $\mathcal L$.

The Invar Tensor Package - The Invar package is introduced, a fast manipulator of generic scalar polynomial expressions formed from the Riemann tensor of a four-dimensional metric-compatible connection. The package can maximally simplify any polynomial containing tensor products of up to seven Riemann tensors within seconds. It has been implemented both in Mathematica and Maple algebraic systems.

Towards a Gauge Invariant Scattering Theory of Cylindrical Gravitational Waves - In this account we investigate an asymptotically flat space-time geometry. In particular, we focus on a pure gravity model with cylindrical symmetry where no matter fields are included. The Einstein-Rosen metric is introduced and the corresponding Einstein equations are solved. By use of the ADM formalism, we derive the observables of the cylindrical gravitational waves. We conclude with an analysis of the algebra of the observables of the Einstein-Rosen waves.

On axisymmetric MHD equilibria with incompressible flows under side conditions - Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition, the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.

Vertex-algebraic structure of the principal subspaces of certain A_1^(1)-modules, I: level one case - This is the first in a series of papers in which we study vertex-algebraic structure of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's principal subspaces associated to standard modules for both untwisted and twisted affine Lie algebras. A key idea is to prove suitable presentations of principal subspaces, without using bases or even ``small'' spanning sets of these spaces. In this paper we prove presentations of the principal subspaces of the basic A_1^(1)-modules. These convenient presentations were previously used in work of Capparelli-Lepowsky-Milas for the purpose of obtaining the classical Rogers-Ramanujan recursion for the graded dimensions of the principal subspaces.

Galaxy Evolution and Environment - The properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with their environment, with red galaxies dominating galaxy clusters and blue galaxies dominating the general field. However, not all field galaxies are young: studies of the colors, line strengths, and M/L ratios of massive early-type galaxies at 0<z<1.3 show that the most massive galaxies do not seem to care about their surroundings, and have very similar ages irrespective of their environment. There is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longer in the field than in clusters, via (nearly) dissipationless mergers of already old galaxies. These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxy formation models, which incorporate AGN feedback to suppress star formation in the most massive halos. Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies with their environment beyond z=1 are difficult, and still somewhat contradictory. Intriguingly both the DEEP2 and VVDS surveys find that the color-density relation disappears at z~1.3, unfortunately just at the point where both surveys become highly incomplete. On the other hand, clustering studies at z~2.5 have shown that red galaxies cluster more strongly than blue galaxies, implying that the color-density relation was already in place at that redshift.

GLSM's for partial flag manifolds - In this paper we outline some aspects of nonabelian gauged linear sigma models. First, we review how partial flag manifolds (generalizing Grassmannians) are described physically by nonabelian gauged linear sigma models, paying attention to realizations of tangent bundles and other aspects pertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau complete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged linear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in which the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is realized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending previous work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM exhibiting the same phenomenon. We tentatively identify the mathematical relationship between such non-birational phases, as examples of Kuznetsov's homological projective duality. Finally, we discuss linear sigma model moduli spaces in these gauged linear sigma models. We argue that the moduli spaces being realized physically by these GLSM's are precisely Quot and hyperquot schemes, as one would expect mathematically.

Warm HCN, C2H2, and CO in the disk of GV Tau - We present the first high-resolution, ground-based observations of HCN and C2H2 toward the T Tauri binary star system GV Tau. We detected strong absorption due to HCN nu_3 and weak C2H2 (nu_3 and nu_2 + (nu_4 + nu_5)^0_+) absorption toward the primary (GV Tau S) but not the infrared companion. We also report CO column densities and rotational temperatures, and present abundances relative to CO of HCN/CO ~0.6% and C2H2/CO ~1.2% and an upper limit for CH4/CO < 0.37% toward GV Tau S. Neither HCN nor C2H2 were detected toward the infrared companion and results suggest that abundances may differ between the two sources.

Towards understanding of birds magnetoreceptor mechanism - In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered mechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.

Another Riemann-Farey Computation - Another approach to constructing an upper bound for the Riemann-Farey sum is described.

Spitzer Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy of Infrared Luminous Galaxies at z~2 II: Diagnostics - We present mid-IR spectral decomposition of a sample of 48 Spitzer-selected ULIRGs spanning z~1-3 and likely L_IR~10^12-10^13Lsun. Our study aims at quantifying the star-formation and AGN processes in these sources which recent results suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. To do this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and extinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated sources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of star-formation activity. These sources have redder mid-IR colors than typical optically-selected quasars. About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission, but none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high 5um hot dust continua. However, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest that star-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. Six of our z~2 sources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At these luminosities, such high EW6.2 ULIRGs do not exist in the local Universe. We find a median optical depth at 9.7um of <tau_9.7>=1.4. This is consistent with local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on SCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show extreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find that our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude more luminous. It is not clear whether our z~2 ULIRGs are simply scaled-up versions of local ULIRGs, or subject to fundamentally different physical processes.

Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a live dark halo - We investigate the Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a dynamically responsive dark halo. It is shown that the disk-halo system becomes nominally Jeans unstable. On small scales the instability is suppressed, if the Toomre stability index Q_T is higher than a certain threshold, but on large scales the Jeans instability sets invariably in. However, using a simple self-consistent disk-halo model it is demonstrated that this occurs on scales which are much larger than the system so that this is indeed only a nominal effect. From a practical point of view the Jeans instability of galactic disks is not affected by a live dark halo.

The multiplicity of planet host stars - New low-mass companions to planet host stars - We present new results from our ongoing multiplicity study of exoplanet host stars, carried out with the infrared camera SofI at ESO-NTT. We have identified new low mass companions to the planet host stars HD101930 and HD65216. HD101930AB is a wide binary systems composed of the planet host star HD101930A and its companion HD101930B which is a M0 to M1 dwarf with a mass of about 0.7Msun separated from the primary by ~73arcsec (2200AU projected separation). HD65216 forms a hierarchical triple system, with a projected separation of 253AU (angular separation of about 7arcsec) between the planet host star HD65216A and its close binary companion HD65216BC, whose two components are separated by only ~0.17arcsec (6AU of projected separation). Two VLT-NACO images separated by 3 years confirm that this system is co-moving to the planet host star. The infrared photometry of HD65216B and C is consistent with a M7 to M8 (0.089Msun), and a L2 to L3 dwarf (0.078Msun), respectively, both close to the sub-stellar limit. An infrared spectrum with VLT-ISAAC of the pair HD65216BC, even though not resolved spatially, confirms this late spectral type. Furthermore, we present H- and K-band ISAAC infrared spectra of HD16141B, the recently detected co-moving companion of the planet host star HD16141A. The infrared spectroscopy as well as the apparent infrared photometry of HD16141B are both fully consistent with a M2 to M3 dwarf located at the distance of the planet host star.

Assessment and Propagation of Input Uncertainty in Tree-based Option Pricing Models - This paper aims to provide a practical example on the assessment and propagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-based methods. Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting that option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close the model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use, and those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative frameworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter uncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options market established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for which there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool to account for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.

Subdiffusion and weak ergodicity breaking in the presence of a reactive boundary - We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions, that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells, are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar

Satellites of Simulated Galaxies: survival, merging, and their relation to the dark and stellar halos - We study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite of N-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a LCDM universe. We find little spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellite population. The velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator of the virial velocity of the halo: \sigma_{sat}/V_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to the Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s and V_{vir}^{M31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than the rotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulated satellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellar halo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the population of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite depends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased toward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our results support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences between stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive ``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive, and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that has survived self-bound until the present.

Fractional Generalization of Kac Integral - Generalization of the Kac integral and Kac method for paths measure based on the Levy distribution has been used to derive fractional diffusion equation. Application to nonlinear fractional Ginzburg-Landau equation is discussed.

Analysis of the Velocity Field of F and G Dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood as a Function of Age - The space velocities from the catalog of Nordstrom et al. (2004) are used to trace variations of a number of kinematic parameters of single F and G dwarfs as a function of their age. The vertex deviation of disk stars increases from 7+- 1 to 15+-2 degrees as the mean age decreases from 4.3 to 1.5 Gyr. The two-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW, and VW planes are analyzed. The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can be followed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr. We find that: (1) in the distributions of the UV velocity components, stars of different types are concentrated toward several stable peaks (the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius Cluster), suggesting that the stars belonging to these formations did not form simultaneously; (2) the peak associated with the Hyades Cluster dominates in all age intervals; and (3) the Hyades peak is strongest for stars with an average age of 1.5 Gyr, suggesting that this peak contains a considerable fraction of stars from the Hyades cluster. The age dependences of the kinematic parameters exhibit a break near 4.5 Gyr, which can be explained as an effect of the different contributions of stars of the thin and thick disks. The Stromberg relation yields a solar LSR velocity of V_{\odot LSR} = (8.7, 6.2, 7.2)+- (0.5, 2.2, 0.8) km/s.

Cosmic M\'enage \`a Trois: The Origin of Satellite Galaxies On Extreme Orbits - We examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite of N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of $L_*$ galaxies in a LCDM universe. Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around, they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii are steadily eroded by dynamical friction. However, a number of outliers are also present, we find that ~1/3 of satellites identified at $z=0$ are on unorthodox orbits, with apocenters that exceed their turnaround radii. This population of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faint member of a satellite pair that has been ejected onto a highly-energetic orbit during its first approach to the primary. Since the concurrent accretion of multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models of galaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31 (such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group members, such as Leo I; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus and Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care must be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to place constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.

Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo calculation of nuclei with A<40 with tensor interactions - We calculate the ground-state energy of 4He, 8He, 16O, and 40Ca using the auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo method in the fixed phase approximation and the Argonne v6' interaction which includes a tensor force. Comparison of our light nuclei results to those of Green's function Monte Carlo calculations shows the accuracy of our method for both open and closed shell nuclei. We also apply it to 16O and 40Ca to show that quantum Monte Carlo methods are now applicable to larger nuclei.

Origin of Discrepancies in Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectra of Molecular Junctions - We report inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) of multilayer molecular junctions with and without incorporated metal nano-particles. The incorporation of metal nanoparticles into our devices leads to enhanced IET intensity and a modified line-shape for some vibrational modes. The enhancement and line-shape modification are both the result of a low lying hybrid metal nanoparticle-molecule electronic level. These observations explain the apparent discrepancy between earlier IETS measurements of alkane thiolate junctions by Kushmerick \emph{et al.} [Nano Lett. \textbf{4}, 639 (2004)] and Wang \emph{et al.} [Nano Lett. \textbf{4}, 643 (2004)].

Photoproduction of pi0-mesons off protons from the Delta(1232) region to E(gamma) = 3 GeV - Photoproduction of pi0 mesons was studied with the Crystal-Barrel detector at ELSA for incident energies from 300 MeV to 3 GeV. Differential cross sections d sigma /d Omega, d sigma/d t, and the total cross section are presented. For E(gamma) < 3 GeV, the angular distributions agree well with the SAID parametrization. At photon energies above 1.5 GeV, a strong forward peaking indicates t-channel exchange to be the dominant process. The rapid variations of the cross section with energy and angle indicate production of resonances. An interpretation of the data within the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis is briefly discussed.

Magnetic and axial-vector transitions of the baryon antidecuplet - We report the recent results of the magnetic transitions and axial-vector transitions of the baryon antidecuplet within the framework of the chiral quark-soliton model. The dynamical model parameters are fixed by experimental data for the magnetic moments of the baryon octet, for the hyperon semileptonic decay constants, and for the singlet axial-vector constant. The transition magnetic moments $\mu_{\Lambda\Sigma}$ and $\mu_{N\Delta}$ are well reproduced and other octet-decuplet and octet-antidecuplet transitions are predicted. In particular, the present calculation of $\mu_{\Sigma\Sigma^*}$ is found to be below the upper bound $0.82\mu_N$ that the SELEX collaboration measured very recently. The results explains consistently the recent findings of a new $N^*$ resonance from the GRAAL and Tohoku LNS group. We also obtain the transition axial-vector constants for the $\Theta^+\to KN$ from which the decay width of the $\Theta^{+}$ pentaquark baryon is determined as a function of the pion-nucleon sigma term $\Sigma_{\pi N}$. We investigate the dependence of the decay width of the $\Theta^{+}$ on the $g_{A}^{(0)}$, with the $g_{A}^{(0)}$ varied within the range of the experimental uncertainty. We show that a small decay width of the $\Theta^{+}\to KN$, i.e. $\Gamma_{\Theta KN} \leq 1$ MeV, is compatible with the values of all known semileptonic decays with the generally accepted value of $g_{A}^{(0)} \approx 0.3$ for the proton.

Quenched limits for transient, zero speed one-dimensional random walk in random environment - We consider a nearest-neighbor, one dimensional random walk $\{X_n\}_{n\geq0}$ in a random i.i.d. environment, in the regime where the walk is transient but with zero speed, so that $X_n$ is of order $n^s$ for some $s<1$. Under the quenched law (i.e., conditioned on the environment), we show that no limit laws are possible: There exist sequences $\{n_k\}$ and $\{x_k\}$ depending on the environment only, such that $X_{n_k}-x_k=o(\log n_k)^2$ (a localized regime). On the other hand, there exist sequences $\{t_m\}$ and $\{s_m\}$ depending on the environment only, such that $\log s_m/\log t_m\to s<1$ and $P_{\omega}(X_{t_m}/s_m\leq x)\to1/2$ for all $x>0$ and $\to0$ for $x\leq0$ (a spread out regime).

Reciprocal transformations and flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces - We consider hydrodynamic systems which possess a local Hamiltonian structure of Dubrovin-Novikov type. To such a system there are also associated an infinite number of nonlocal Hamiltonian structures. We give necessary and sufficient conditions so that, after a nonlinear transformation of the independent variables, the reciprocal system still possesses a local Hamiltonian structure of Dubrovin-Novikov type. We show that, under our hypotheses, bi-hamiltonicity is preserved by the reciprocal transformation. Finally we apply such results to reciprocal systems of genus g Whitham-KdV modulation equations.

HS1857+5144: A hot and young pre-cataclysmic variable - We report the discovery of a new white dwarf/M dwarf binary, HS1857+5144, identified in the Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS). Time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry were carried out to determine the properties of this new cataclysmic variable progenitor pre-CV). The light curves of HS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band, respectively. The large amplitude of the brightness variation results from a reflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star, suggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocity study confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. A model atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum light provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun and Twd=~70000-100000 K, respectively. The detection of HeII 4686 absorption classifies the primary star of HS1857+5144 as a DAO white dwarf. Combining the results from our spectroscopy and photometry, we estimate the mass of the companion star and the binary inclination to be Msec=~0.15-0.30 Msun and i=~45-55 deg, respectively. We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest pre-CV known to date. The cooling age of the white dwarf suggests that the present system has just emerged from a common envelope phase ~10^5 yr ago. HS1857+5144 will start mass transfer within or below the 2-3h period gap.

$^{10}$Li spectrum from $^{11}$Li fragmentation - A recently developed time dependent model for the excitation of a nucleon from a bound state to a continuum resonant state in the system n+core is applied to the study of the population of the low energy continuum of the unbound $^{10}$Li system obtained from $^{11}$Li fragmentation. Comparison of the model results to new data from the GSI laboratory suggests that the reaction mechanism is dominated by final state effects rather than by the sudden process, but for the population of the l=0 virtual state, in which case the two mechanisms give almost identical results. There is also, for the first time, a clear evidence for the population of a d$_{5/2}$ resonance in $^{10}$Li.

Asymptotics of the Euler number of bipartite graphs - We define the Euler number of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices to be the number of labelings of the vertices with $1,2,...,n$ such that the vertices alternate in being local maxima and local minima. We reformulate the problem of computing the Euler number of certain subgraphs of the Cartesian product of a graph $G$ with the path $P_m$ in terms of self adjoint operators. The asymptotic expansion of the Euler number is given in terms of the eigenvalues of the associated operator. For two classes of graphs, the comb graphs and the Cartesian product $P_2 \Box P_m$, we numerically solve the eigenvalue problem.

Unicast and Multicast Qos Routing with Soft Constraint Logic Programming - We present a formal model to represent and solve the unicast/multicast routing problem in networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To attain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph (unicast) or and-or graph (multicast), where the weight on a connector corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems. Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At last, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks and we suggest how the performance can be improved.

Zero point energy on extra dimension: Noncommutative Torus - In this paper we calculate the zero point energy density experienced by observers on M^4 due to a massless scalar field defined throughout M^4 x T^2_F, where T^2_F are fuzzy extra dimensions. Using the Green's function approach we calculate the energy density for the commutative torus and the fuzzy torus. We calculate then the energy density for the fuzzy torus using the Hamiltonian approach. Agreement is shown between Green's function and Hamiltonian approaches.

Three-body collisions in Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck theory - Aiming at a microscopic description of heavy ion collisions in the beam energy region of about 10 A GeV, we extend the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) transport model by including a relativistic mean field, in-medium baryon-baryon cross sections and three-body collisions. The model is then compared with experimental data for central Au+Au collisions at 2-10 A GeV and central Pb+Pb collisions at 30 and 40 A GeV on the proton rapidity spectra, the midrapidity yields of $\pi^+$, $K^\pm$ and $(\Lambda+\Sigma^0)$, and the transverse mass spectra of $\pi^\pm$ and $K^\pm$. The three-body collisions increase the inverse slope parameters of the hadron $m_\perp$-spectra to a good agreement with the data.

Learning more from the Lorentz transformations - Admitting the validity of Lorentz transformations for the space as time coordinates of the same event we derive their differential form in order to underline the correct prerequisites for the application of time and length contraction or dilation effects. Furthermore we quantify the simultaneity error occurring in the relativity theory. Having done this, we analyse the root cause of these effects and identify it with a finite phase velocity associated with the moving frame. We define this phase velocity by analogy to the de Broglie wave associated with a moving particle. Based on this construct we demonstrate that the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary particles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding observers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at light speed is a relativistic invariant. Therefore the universe and its matter / energy may be seen as a superposition of waves propagating such that their phase is the same for all corresponding observers. The wave phase may replace the time as an invariant and universal reference.

On the Mapping of Time-Dependent Densities onto Potentials in Quantum Mechanics - The mapping of time-dependent densities on potentials in quantum mechanics is critically examined. The issue is of significance ever since Runge and Gross (Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 997 (1984)) established the uniqueness of the mapping, forming a theoretical basis for time-dependent density functional theory. We argue that besides existence (so called v-representability) and uniqueness there is an important question of stability and chaos. Studying a 2-level system we find innocent, almost constant densities that cannot be constructed from any potential (non-existence). We further show via a Lyapunov analysis that the mapping of densities on potentials has chaotic regions in this case. In real space the situation is more subtle. V-representability is formally assured but the mapping is often chaotic making the actual construction of the potential almost impossible. The chaotic nature of the mapping, studied for the first time here, has serious consequences regarding the possibility of using TDDFT in real-time settings.

New Jarlskog determinant from Physics above the GUT Scal - We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum gravitational (Planck scale) effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1) invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects.

Generalized Smirnov statistics and the distribution of prime factors - We apply recent bounds of the author (math.PR/0609224) for generalized Smirnov statistics to the distribution of integers whose prime factors satisfy certain systems of inequalities.

Models of Opinion Formation: Influence of Opinion Leaders - This paper studies the evolution of the distribution of opinions in a population of individuals in which there exist two distinct subgroups of highly-committed, well-connected opinion leaders endowed with a strong convincing power. Each individual, located at a vertex of a directed graph, is characterized by her name, the list of people she is interacting with, her level of awareness, and her opinion. Various temporal evolutions according to different local rules are compared in order to find under which conditions the formation of strongly polarized subgroups, each adopting the opinion of one of the two groups of opinion leaders, is favored.

Chiral Mechanisms Leading to Orbital Quantum Structures in the Nucleon - Color confinement and chiral symmetry specify some important territory for the study of hadronic physics. Any hadron can be defined as a color-singlet composite system of qurks and gluons, the fundamental fields of qcd, while the landscape of the hadronic spectrum is dominated by the fact that two quark flavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental scale of this theory. Measurements sensitive to the orbital angular momenta of the color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics and confinement in a unique manner. This pageant can be explored by an evaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the normalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the Boer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures in the chiral quark model represent an evaluation of Collins functions for a confined system defined by the quantum numbers of the nucleon in the constituent quark model. The orbital structure functions for antiquarks can also be specified within the basic framework of this approach while the normalization of the gluon orbital structure function requires some additional assumptions.

Quantum control and entanglement using periodic driving fields - We propose a scheme for producing directed motion in a lattice system by applying a periodic driving potential. By controlling the dynamics by means of the effect known as coherent destruction of tunneling, we demonstrate a novel ratchet-like effect that enables particles to be coherently manipulated and steered without requiring local control. Entanglement between particles can also be controllably generated, which points to the attractive possibility of using these technique for quantum information processing.

Intrinsic ripples in graphene - The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is subject of a long standing theoretical debate. According to the so called Mermin-Wagner theorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a two-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the recent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes these issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 70 \AA which is compatible with experimental findings (50-100 \AA) but not with the current understanding of stability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.

Counting and manipulating single electrons using a carbon nanotube transistor - We report on the electric measurements of an individual Au nanoparticle with an ultra-high contact resistance of about $10^{19} \Omega$. The high-impedance measurements have been carried out by counting the electrons that are transferred onto the particle. In order to do this, a carbon nanotube is used as the electrode for the supply of electrons but also as the detector of the charge transfer. Measurements using single-electron detection allow us to determine the separation between the electron states in the Au nanoparticle, which is about 4 meV, consistent with the charging energy of the particle. Single-electron detection with nanotubes offers great promise for the study of electron transfer in highly resistive molecular systems.

Le module dendriforme sur le groupe cyclique - The structure of anticyclic operad on the Dendriform operad defines in particular a matrix of finite order acting on the vector space spanned by planar binary trees. We compute its characteristic polynomial and propose a (compatible) conjecture for the characteristic polynomial of the Coxeter transformation for the Tamari lattice, which is mostly a square root of this matrix.

Representation Theorems for Quadratic ${\cal F}$-Consistent Nonlinear Expectations - In this paper we extend the notion of ``filtration-consistent nonlinear expectation" (or "${\cal F}$-consistent nonlinear expectation") to the case when it is allowed to be dominated by a $g$-expectation that may have a quadratic growth. We show that for such a nonlinear expectation many fundamental properties of a martingale can still make sense, including the Doob-Meyer type decomposition theorem and the optional sampling theorem. More importantly, we show that any quadratic ${\cal F}$-consistent nonlinear expectation with a certain domination property must be a quadratic $g$-expectation. The main contribution of this paper is the finding of the domination condition to replace the one used in all the previous works, which is no longer valid in the quadratic case. We also show that the representation generator must be deterministic, continuous, and actually must be of the simple form.

Film Thickness Changes in EHD Sliding Contacts Lubricated by a Fatty Alcohol - This paper describes the appearance of abnormal film thickness features formed in elastohydrodynamic contacts lubricated by a fatty alcohol. Experiments were conducted by varying the slide to roll ratio between a steel ball and a glass disk in a ball-on-disk type device. Lauric alcohol was used as lubricant and film thickness was measured in the contact area by optical interferometry. Experimental results showed that the film thickness distributions under pure rolling conditions remained classical whereas the film shape changed when the slide to roll ratio was increased. The thickness in the central contact area increased and in the same time inlet and exit film thicknesses were modified. In addition, the film shapes observed when the ball surface was moving faster than the disk one and those obtained in the opposite case were different, i.e. when opposite signs but equal absolute values of the slide to roll ratio were applied.

A unified shear-thinning treatment of both film thickness and traction in EHD - A conclusive demonstration has been provided that the nature of the shear-thinning, that affects both film thickness and traction in EHL contacts, follows the ordinary power-law rule that has been described by many empirical models of which Carreau is but one example. This was accomplished by accurate measurements in viscometers of the shear response of a PAO that possesses a very low critical stress for shear-thinning and accurate measurements in-contact of film thickness and traction under conditions which accentuate the shear-thinning effect. The in-contact central film thickness and traction were entirely predictable from the rheological properties obtained from viscometers using simple calculations. These data should be invaluable to researchers endeavoring to accurately simulate Hertz zone behavior since the shear-thinning rheology is extensively characterized and accurate in-contact data are available to test. In addition, a new model has been introduced that may be useful for the rheological characterization of mixtures.

Super Low Traction under EHD and Mixed Lubrication Regimes - After the pioneered experimental works on superlubricity by Martin et al. on MoS2 [1], Hirano et al. on tungsten and silicon [2] and the further confirmation by Dienwiebel et al. on graphite [3], many groups around the word investigated the occurrence of near frictionless sliding contacts. This large mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e. fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak perspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles in recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above conditions.

Phenomenology with Massive Neutrinos - The current status and some perspectives of the phenomenology of massive neutrinos is reviewed. We start with the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter. We summarize the results of neutrino experiments using solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino beams. We update the leptonic parameters derived from the three-neutrino oscillation interpretation of this data. We describe the method and present results on our understanding of the solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes by direct extraction from the corresponding neutrino event rates. We present some tests of different forms of new physics which induce new sources of leptonic flavor transitions in vacuum and in matter which can be performed with the present neutrino data. The aim and potential of future neutrino experiments and facilities to further advance in these fronts is also briefly summarized. Last, the implications of the LSND observations are discussed, and the status of extended models which could accommodate all flavor-mixing signals is presented in the light of the recent results from MiniBooNE.

A calculation of the shear viscosity in SU(3) gluodynamics - We perform a lattice Monte-Carlo calculation of the two-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor at finite temperature in the SU(3) gauge theory. Unprecedented precision is obtained thanks to a multi-level algorithm. The lattice operators are renormalized non-perturbatively and the classical discretization errors affecting the correlators are corrected for. A robust upper bound for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is derived, eta/s < 1.0, and our best estimate is eta/s = 0.134(33) at T=1.65Tc under the assumption of smoothness of the spectral function in the low-frequency region.

A Way to Dynamically Overcome the Cosmological Constant Problem - The Cosmological Constant problem can be solved once we require that the full standard Einstein Hilbert lagrangian, gravity plus matter, is multiplied by a total derivative. We analyze such a picture writing the total derivative as the covariant gradient of a new vector field (b_mu). The dynamics of this b_mu field can play a key role in the explanation of the present cosmological acceleration of the Universe.

Regularity properties in the classification program for separable amenable C*-algebras - We report on recent progress in the program to classify separable amenable C*-algebras. Our emphasis is on the newly apparent role of regularity properties such as finite decomposition rank, strict comparison of positive elements, and Z-stability, and on the importance of the Cuntz semigroup. We include a brief history of the program's successes since 1989, a more detailed look at the Villadsen-type algebras which have so dramatically changed the landscape, and a collection of announcements on the structure and properties of the Cuntz semigroup.

Equation of state of atomic systems beyond s-wave determined by the lowest order constrained variational method: Large scattering length limit - Dilute Fermi systems with large s-wave scattering length a_s exhibit universal properties if the interparticle spacing r_o greatly exceeds the range of the underlying two-body interaction potential. In this regime, r_o is the only relevant length scale and observables such as the energy per particle depend only on r_o (or, equivalently, the energy E_{FG} of the free Fermi gas). This paper investigates Bose and Fermi systems with non-vanishing angular momentum l using the lowest order constrained variational method. We focus on the regime where the generalized scattering length becomes large and determine the relevant length scales. For Bose gases with large generalized scattering lengths, we obtain simple expressions for the energy per particle in terms of a l-dependent length scale \xi_l, which depends on the range of the underlying two-body potential and the average interparticle spacing. We discuss possible implications for dilute two-component Fermi systems with finite l. Furthermore, we determine the equation of state of liquid and gaseous bosonic helium.

On Charge Conservation and The Equivalence Principle in the Noncommutative Spacetime - We investigate one of the consequences of the twisted Poincare symmetry. We derive the charge conservation law and show that the equivalence principle is satisfied in the canonical noncommutative spacetime. We applied the twisted Poincare symmetry to the Weinberg's analysis. To this end, we generalize our earlier construction of the twisted S matrix \cite{Bu}, which apply the noncommutativity to the fourier modes, to the massless fields of integer spins. The transformation formula for the twisted S matrix for the massless fields of integer spin has been obtained. For massless fields of spin 1, we obtain the conservation of charge, and the universality of coupling constant for massless fields of spin 2, which can be interpreted as the equality of gravitational mass and inertial mass, i.e., the equivalence principle.

Critical Scaling of Shear Viscosity at the Jamming Transition - We carry out numerical simulations to study transport behavior about the jamming transition of a model granular material in two dimensions at zero temperature. Shear viscosity \eta is computed as a function of particle volume density \rho and applied shear stress \sigma, for diffusively moving particles with a soft core interaction. We find an excellent scaling collapse of our data as a function of the scaling variable \sigma/|\rho_c-\rho|^\Delta, where \rho_c is the critical density at \sigma=0 ("point J"), and \Delta is the crossover scaling critical exponent. Our results show that jamming is a true critical phenomenon, extending to driven steady states along the non-equilibrium \sigma axis of the \rho-\sigma phase diagram.

Polar actions on compact Euclidean hypersurfaces - Given an isometric immersion $f\colon M^n\to \R^{n+1}$ of a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ into Euclidean space of dimension $n+1$, we prove that the identity component $Iso^0(M^n)$ of the isometry group $Iso(M^n)$ of $M^n$ admits an orthogonal representation $\Phi\colon Iso^0(M^n)\to SO(n+1)$ such that $f\circ g=\Phi(g)\circ f$ for every $g\in Iso^0(M^n)$. If $G$ is a closed connected subgroup of $Iso(M^n)$ acting locally polarly on $M^n$, we prove that $\Phi(G)$ acts polarly on $\R^{n+1}$, and we obtain that $f(M^n)$ is given as $\Phi(G)(L)$, where $L$ is a hypersurface of a section which is invariant under the Weyl group of the $\Phi(G)$-action. We also find several sufficient conditions for such an $f$ to be a rotation hypersurface. Finally, we show that compact Euclidean rotation hypersurfaces of dimension $n\geq 3$ are characterized by their underlying warped product structure.

Tests of Bayesian Model Selection Techniques for Gravitational Wave Astronomy - The analysis of gravitational wave data involves many model selection problems. The most important example is the detection problem of selecting between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics, and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection. Future space based detectors, such as the \emph{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model evidence. We find good agreement between all of the approaches.

All tight multipartite Bell correlation inequalities for an arbitrary number of dichotomic observables per observer - Derivation of the full set of Bell inequalities involving correlation functions, for two parties, with binary observables, and N possible local settings is not as easy as it seemed. The proof of v1 is wrong. Additionaly one can find a counterexample, which will be presented soon. Thus our thesis is dead. Still the series of Bell inequalities discussed in the manuscript (v1) form a necessary condition for local realism, and are tight. They are tight and complete (sufficient) only for N=3 settings per observer (as shown in quant-ph/0611086, fortunately using an entirely different approach).

A Cascade Model for Particle Concentration and Enstrophy in Fully Developed Turbulence with Mass Loading Feedback - A cascade model is described based on multiplier distributions determined from 3D direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent particle laden flows, which include two-way coupling between the phases at global mass loadings equal to unity. The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral methods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range 34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs, which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations. Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from unloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100 times the gas density. This approach has promise for significant computational savings in certain applications.

Unifying Evolutionary and Network Dynamics - Many important real-world networks manifest "small-world" properties such as scale-free degree distributions, small diameters, and clustering. The most common model of growth for these networks is "preferential attachment", where nodes acquire new links with probability proportional to the number of links they already have. We show that preferential attachment is a special case of the process of molecular evolution. We present a new single-parameter model of network growth that unifies varieties of preferential attachment with the quasispecies equation (which models molecular evolution), and also with the Erdos-Renyi random graph model. We suggest some properties of evolutionary models that might be applied to the study of networks. We also derive the form of the degree distribution resulting from our algorithm, and we show through simulations that the process also models aspects of network growth. The unification allows mathematical machinery developed for evolutionary dynamics to be applied in the study of network dynamics, and vice versa.

The LuckyCam Survey for Very Low Mass Binaries II: 13 new M4.5-M6.0 Binaries - We present results from a high-angular-resolution survey of 78 very low mass (VLM) binary systems with 6.0 <= V-K colour <= 7.5 and proper motion >= 0.15 arcsec/yr. 21 VLM binaries were detected, 13 of them new discoveries. The new binary systems range in separation between 0.18 arcsec and 1.3 arcsec. The distance-corrected binary fraction is 13.5% (+6.5%/-4%), in agreement with previous results. 9 of the new binary systems have orbital radii > 10 AU, including a new wide VLM binary with 27 AU projected orbital separation. One of the new systems forms two components of a 2300 AU separation triple system. We find that the orbital radius distribution of the binaries with V-K < 6.5 in this survey appears to be different from that of redder (lower-mass) objects, suggesting a possible rapid change in the orbital radius distribution at around the M5 spectral type. The target sample was also selected to investigate X-ray activity among VLM binaries. There is no detectable correlation between excess X-Ray emission and the frequency and binary properties of the VLM systems.

The Discovery of a Companion to the Lowest Mass White Dwarf - We report the detection of a radial velocity companion to SDSS J091709.55+463821.8, the lowest mass white dwarf currently known with M~0.17Msun. The radial velocity of the white dwarf shows variations with a semi-amplitude of 148.8 km/s and a period of 7.5936 hours, which implies a companion mass of M > 0.28Msun. The lack of evidence of a companion in the optical photometry forces any main-sequence companion to be smaller than 0.1Msun, hence a low mass main sequence star companion is ruled out for this system. The companion is most likely another white dwarf, and we present tentative evidence for an evolutionary scenario which could have produced it. However, a neutron star companion cannot be ruled out and follow-up radio observations are required to search for a pulsar companion.

A Measure of de Sitter Entropy and Eternal Inflation - We show that in any model of non-eternal inflation satisfying the null energy condition, the area of the de Sitter horizon increases by at least one Planck unit in each inflationary e-folding. This observation gives an operational meaning to the finiteness of the entropy S_dS of an inflationary de Sitter space eventually exiting into an asymptotically flat region: the asymptotic observer is never able to measure more than e^(S_dS) independent inflationary modes. This suggests a limitation on the amount of de Sitter space outside the horizon that can be consistently described at the semiclassical level, fitting well with other examples of the breakdown of locality in quantum gravity, such as in black hole evaporation. The bound does not hold in models of inflation that violate the null energy condition, such as ghost inflation. This strengthens the case for the thermodynamical interpretation of the bound as conventional black hole thermodynamics also fails in these models, strongly suggesting that these theories are incompatible with basic gravitational principles.

Kondo-lattice screening in a d-wave superconductor - We show that local moment screening in a Kondo lattice with d-wave superconducting conduction electrons is qualitatively different from the corresponding single Kondo impurity case. Despite the conduction-electron pseudogap, Kondo-lattice screening is stable if the gap amplitude obeys $\Delta <\sqrt{\tk D}$, in contrast to the single impurity condition $\Delta <\tk$ (where $\tk$ is the Kondo temperature for $\Delta = 0$ and D is the bandwidth). Our theory explains the heavy electron behavior in the d-wave superconductor Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

Coincident, 100 kpc-scale damped Lyman alpha absorption towards a binary QSO: how large are galaxies at z ~ 3? - We report coincident damped Lyman alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorption at z = 2.66 and z = 2.94 towards the z ~ 3 13.8 arcsecond separation binary quasar SDSS 1116+4118 AB. At the redshifts of the absorbers, this angular separation corresponds to a proper transverse separation of ~ 110 kpc. A third absorber, a sub-DLA at z = 2.47, is detected towards SDSS 1116+4118 B, but no corresponding high column density absorber is present towards SDSS 1116+4118 A. We use high resolution galaxy simulations and a clustering analysis to interpret the coincident absorption and its implications for galaxy structure at z ~ 3. We conclude that the common absorption in the two lines of sight is unlikely to arise from a single galaxy, or a galaxy plus satellite system, and is more feasibly explained by a group of two or more galaxies with separations ~ 100 kpc. The impact of these findings on single line of sight observations is also discussed; we show that abundances of DLAs may be affected by up to a few tenths of a dex by line of sight DLA blending. From a Keck ESI spectrum of the two quasars, we measure metal column densities for all five absorbers and determine abundances for the three absorbers with log N(HI) > 20. For the two highest N(HI) absorbers, we determine high levels of metal enrichment, corresponding to 1/3 and 1/5 solar. These metallicities are amongst the highest measured for DLAs at any redshift and are consistent with values measured in Lyman break galaxies at 2 < z < 3. For the DLA at z = 2.94 we also infer an approximately solar ratio of alpha-to-Fe peak elements from [S/Zn] = +0.05, and measure an upper limit for the molecular fraction in this particular line of sight of log f(H_2)< -5.5.

Redefining the Missing Satellites Problem - Numerical simulations of Milky-Way size Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos predict a steeply rising mass function of small dark matter subhalos and a substructure count that greatly outnumbers the observed satellites of the Milky Way. Several proposed explanations exist, but detailed comparison between theory and observation in terms of the maximum circular velocity (Vmax) of the subhalos is hampered by the fact that Vmax for satellite halos is poorly constrained. We present comprehensive mass models for the well-known Milky Way dwarf satellites, and derive likelihood functions to show that their masses within 0.6 kpc (M_0.6) are strongly constrained by the present data. We show that the M_0.6 mass function of luminous satellite halos is flat between ~ 10^7 and 10^8 M_\odot. We use the ``Via Lactea'' N-body simulation to show that the M_0.6 mass function of CDM subhalos is steeply rising over this range. We rule out the hypothesis that the 11 well-known satellites of the Milky Way are hosted by the 11 most massive subhalos. We show that models where the brightest satellites correspond to the earliest forming subhalos or the most massive accreted objects both reproduce the observed mass function. A similar analysis with the newly-discovered dwarf satellites will further test these scenarios and provide powerful constraints on the CDM small-scale power spectrum and warm dark matter models.

Low-density graph codes that are optimal for source/channel coding and binning - We describe and analyze the joint source/channel coding properties of a class of sparse graphical codes based on compounding a low-density generator matrix (LDGM) code with a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Our first pair of theorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees remaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously optimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are performed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we prove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the rate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel coding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the capacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our compound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve the Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as the Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI). Although the current results are based on optimal encoding and decoding, the proposed graphical codes have sparse structure and high girth that renders them well-suited to message-passing and other efficient decoding procedures.

Comments on Charges and Near-Horizon Data of Black Rings - We study how the charges of the black rings measured at the asymptotic infinity are encoded in the near-horizon metric and gauge potentials, independent of the detailed structure of the connecting region. Our analysis clarifies how different sets of four-dimensional charges can be assigned to a single five-dimensional object under the Kaluza-Klein reduction. Possible choices are related by the Witten effect on dyons and by the large gauge transformation in four and five dimensions, respectively.

Odd Triplet Pairing in clean Superconductor/Ferromagnet heterostructures - We study triplet pairing correlations in clean Ferromagnet (F)/Superconductor (S) nanojunctions, via fully self consistent solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We consider FSF trilayers, with S being an s-wave superconductor, and an arbitrary angle $\alpha$ between the magnetizations of the two F layers. We find that contrary to some previous expectations, triplet correlations, odd in time, are induced in both the S and F layers in the clean limit. We investigate their behavior as a function of time, position, and $\alpha$. The triplet amplitudes are largest at times on the order of the inverse ``Debye'' frequency, and at that time scale they are long ranged in both S and F. The zero temperature condensation energy is found to be lowest when the magnetizations are antiparallel.

The S-parameter in Holographic Technicolor Models - We study the S parameter, considering especially its sign, in models of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in extra dimensions, with fermions localized near the UV brane. Such models are conjectured to be dual to 4D strong dynamics triggering EWSB. The motivation for such a study is that a negative value of S can significantly ameliorate the constraints from electroweak precision data on these models, allowing lower mass scales (TeV or below) for the new particles and leading to easier discovery at the LHC. We first extend an earlier proof of S>0 for EWSB by boundary conditions in arbitrary metric to the case of general kinetic functions for the gauge fields or arbitrary kinetic mixing. We then consider EWSB in the bulk by a Higgs VEV showing that S is positive for arbitrary metric and Higgs profile, assuming that the effects from higher-dimensional operators in the 5D theory are sub-leading and can therefore be neglected. For the specific case of AdS_5 with a power law Higgs profile, we also show that S ~ + O(1), including effects of possible kinetic mixing from higher-dimensional operator (of NDA size) in the $5D$ theory. Therefore, our work strongly suggests that S is positive in calculable models in extra dimensions.

Energy Functionals for the Parabolic Monge-Ampere Equation - We introduce certain energy functionals to the complex Monge-Ampere equation over a bounded domain with inhomogeneous boundary condition, and use these functionals to show the convergence of the solution to the parabolic Monge-Ampere equation.

Compatible Actions and Cohomology of Crystallographic Groups - We compute the cohomology of crystallographic groups with holonomy of prime order. As an application we compute the group of gerbes associated to many six--dimensional toroidal orbifolds arising in string theory.

Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by Fractional Noise and Local Time - The aim of this paper is to study the $d$-dimensional stochastic heat equation with a multiplicative Gaussian noise which is white in space and it has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $% H\in (0,1)$ in time. Two types of equations are considered. First we consider the equation in the It\^{o}-Skorohod sense, and later in the Stratonovich sense. An explicit chaos development for the solution is obtained. On the other hand, the moments of the solution are expressed in terms of the exponential moments of some weighted intersection local time of the Brownian motion.

Extended envelopes around Galactic Cepheids III. Y Oph and alpha Per from near-infrared interferometry with CHARA/FLUOR - Unbiased angular diameter measurements are required for accurate distances to Cepheids using the interferometric Baade Wesselink method (IBWM). The precision of this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the 1.5% level. At this level, the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and the presence of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The observations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric visibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic presence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the IBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for which the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant (alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted these data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our observations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD is explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph, when compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded by a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other Cepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc. Additional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are surrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after observing four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection around a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides confidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss mechanism for the Cepheids.

Squark and Gaugino Hadroproduction and Decays in Non-Minimal Flavour Violating Supersymmetry - We present an extensive analysis of squark and gaugino hadroproduction and decays in non-minimal flavour violating supersymmetry. We employ the so-called super-CKM basis to define the possible misalignment of quark and squark rotations, and we use generalized (possibly complex) charges to define the mutual couplings of (s)quarks and gauge bosons/gauginos. The cross sections for all squark-(anti-)squark/gaugino pair and squark-gaugino associated production processes as well as their decay widths are then given in compact analytic form. For four different constrained supersymmetry breaking models with non-minimal flavour violation in the second/third generation squark sector only, we establish the parameter space regions allowed/favoured by low-energy, electroweak precision, and cosmological constraints and display the chirality and flavour decomposition of all up- and down-type squark mass eigenstates. Finally, we compute numerically the dependence of a representative sample of production cross sections at the LHC on the off-diagonal mass matrix elements in the experimentally allowed/favoured ranges.

Transaction-Oriented Simulation In Ad Hoc Grids - This paper analyses the possibilities of performing parallel transaction-oriented simulations with a special focus on the space-parallel approach and discrete event simulation synchronisation algorithms that are suitable for transaction-oriented simulation and the target environment of Ad Hoc Grids. To demonstrate the findings a Java-based parallel transaction-oriented simulator for the simulation language GPSS/H is implemented on the basis of the promising Shock Resistant Time Warp synchronisation algorithm and using the Grid framework ProActive. The validation of this parallel simulator shows that the Shock Resistant Time Warp algorithm can successfully reduce the number of rolled back Transaction moves but it also reveals circumstances in which the Shock Resistant Time Warp algorithm can be outperformed by the normal Time Warp algorithm. The conclusion of this paper suggests possible improvements to the Shock Resistant Time Warp algorithm to avoid such problems.

Gauge invariance in gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories - We discuss gravity-like formulations of massive Abelian and non-Abelian gauge field theories in four space-time dimensions with particular emphasis on the issue of gauge invariance. Alternative descriptions in terms of antisymmetric tensor fields and geometric variables, respectively, are analysed. In both approaches St\"uckelberg degrees of freedom factor out. We also demonstrate, in the Abelian case, that the massless limit for the gauge propagator, which does not exist in the vector potential formulation, is well-defined for the antisymmetric tensor fields.

On-line Chain Partitions of Up-growing Semi-orders - On-line chain partition is a two-player game between Spoiler and Algorithm. Spoiler presents a partially ordered set, point by point. Algorithm assigns incoming points (immediately and irrevocably) to the chains which constitute a chain partition of the order. The value of the game for orders of width $w$ is a minimum number $\fVal(w)$ such that Algorithm has a strategy using at most $\fVal(w)$ chains on orders of width at most $w$. We analyze the chain partition game for up-growing semi-orders. Surprisingly, the golden ratio comes into play and the value of the game is $\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\; w \rfloor$.

An Electromagnetic Calorimeter for the JLab Real Compton Scattering Experiment - A lead-glass hodoscope calorimeter that was constructed for use in the Jefferson Lab Real Compton Scattering experiment is described. The detector provides a measurement of the coordinates and the energy of scattered photons in the GeV energy range with resolutions of 5 mm and 6%/\sqrt(E{\gamma} [GeV]). Features of both the detector design and its performance in the high luminosity environment during the experiment are presented.

Multiplicity Fluctuations in Au+Au Collisions at RHIC - The preliminary data of the PHENIX collaboration for the scaled variances of charged hadron multiplicity fluctuations in Au+Au at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV are analyzed within the model of independent sources. We use the HSD transport model to calculate the participant number fluctuations and the number of charged hadrons per nucleon participant in different centrality bins. This combined picture leads to a good agreement with the PHENIX data and suggests that the measured multiplicity fluctuations result dominantly from participant number fluctuations. The role of centrality selection and acceptance is discussed separately.

Near and Mid-IR Photometry of the Pleiades, and a New List of Substellar Candidate Members - We make use of new near and mid-IR photometry of the Pleiades cluster in order to help identify proposed cluster members. We also use the new photometry with previously published photometry to define the single-star main sequence locus at the age of the Pleiades in a variety of color-magnitude planes. The new near and mid-IR photometry extend effectively two magnitudes deeper than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a new set of candidate very low mass and sub-stellar mass members of the Pleiades in the central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate members fainter than Ks =14 (corresponding to 0.1 Mo). These candidate members should eventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made down to of order 0.04 solar masses. We also use new IRAC data, in particular the images obtained at 8 um, in order to comment briefly on interstellar dust in and near the Pleiades. We confirm, as expected, that -- with one exception -- a sample of low mass stars recently identified as having 24 um excesses due to debris disks do not have significant excesses at IRAC wavelengths. However, evidence is also presented that several of the Pleiades high mass stars are found to be impacting with local condensations of the molecular cloud that is passing through the Pleiades at the current epoch.

Analysis of the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function - The IEEE 802.11e standard revises the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of the former IEEE 802.11 standard for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provision in the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function of 802.11e defines multiple Access Categories (AC) with AC-specific Contention Window (CW) sizes, Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS) values, and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limits to support MAC-level QoS and prioritization. We propose an analytical model for the EDCA function which incorporates an accurate CW, AIFS, and TXOP differentiation at any traffic load. The proposed model is also shown to capture the effect of MAC layer buffer size on the performance. Analytical and simulation results are compared to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for varying traffic loads, EDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer space.

Charge Ordering in Half-Doped Manganites: Weak Charge Disproportion and Leading Mechanisms - The apparent contradiction between the recently observed weak charge disproportion and the traditional Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{4+}$ picture of the charge-orbital orders in half-doped manganites is resolved by a novel Wannier states analysis of the LDA$+U$ electronic structure. Strong electron itinerancy in this charge-transfer system significantly delocalizes the occupied low-energy "Mn$^{3+}$" Wannier states such that charge leaks into the "Mn$^{4+}$"-sites. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the charge order are quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. The electron-electron interaction is found to play a role as important as the electron-lattice interaction. \ignore{A general picture of doped holes in strongly correlated charge-transfer systems is presented and applied to the study of charge order in half-doped manganites, using a novel Wannier states analysis of the LDA$+U$ electronic structure. While residing primarily in the oxygen atoms, the doped holes form additional effective $e_g$ orbitals at the low-energy scale, leading to an effective Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{4+}$ valence picture that enables weak charge disproportion, resolving the current serious contradictions between the recent experimental observations of charge distribution and traditional models. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the observed charge order are quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian

Direct extraction of one-loop integral coefficients - We present a general procedure for obtaining the coefficients of the scalar bubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients are extracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of the corresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specific parameterisation of the cut loop momentum we can uniquely identify the coefficients of the desired integral functions simply by examining the behaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the cut loop momentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalar integral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCD and electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recently computed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude $A_6(1^-,2^+,3^-,4^+,5^-,6^+)$. The direct nature of this extraction procedure allows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure.

Comment on Electroweak Higgs as a Pseudo-Goldstone Boson of Broken Scale Invariance - The first model of Foot, Kobakhidze and Volkas described in their work in arXiv:0704.1165 [hep-ph] is a tailored version of our model on broken scale invariance in the standard model presented in hep-th/0403039.

Hard x-ray photoemission study of LaAlO3/LaVO3 multilayers - We have studied the electronic structure of multilayers composed of a band insulator LaAlO$_3$ (LAO) and a Mott insulator LaVO$_3$ (LVO) by means of hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, which has a probing depth as large as $\sim 60 {\AA}$. The Mott-Hubbard gap of LVO remained open at the interface, indicating that the interface is insulating unlike the LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ multilayers. We found that the valence of V in LVO were partially converted from V$^{3+}$ to V$^{4+}$ only at the interface on the top side of the LVO layer and that the amount of V$^{4+}$ increased with LVO layer thickness. We suggest that the electronic reconstruction to eliminate the polarity catastrophe inherent in the polar heterostructure is the origin of the highly asymmetric valence change at the LVO/LAO interfaces.

Performance Analysis of the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function using Cycle Time Approach - The recently ratified IEEE 802.11e standard defines the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning in the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The EDCA uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and slotted Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) mechanism. We present a simple mathematical analysis framework for the EDCA function. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed random access systems exhibit cyclic behavior where each station successfully transmits a packet in a cycle. Our analysis shows that an AC-specific cycle time exists for the EDCA function. Validating the theoretical results via simulations, we show that the proposed analysis accurately captures EDCA saturation performance in terms of average throughput, medium access delay, and packet loss ratio. The cycle time analysis is a simple and insightful substitute for previously proposed more complex EDCA models.

ALHEP symbolic algebra program for high-energy physics - ALHEP is the symbolic algebra program for high-energy physics. It deals with amplitudes calculation, matrix element squaring, Wick theorem, dimensional regularization, tensor reduction of loop integrals and simplification of final expressions. The program output includes: Fortran code for differential cross section, Mathematica files to view results and intermediate steps and TeX source for Feynman diagrams. The PYTHIA interface is available. The project website http://www.hep.by/alhep contains up-to-date executables, manual and script examples.

Simulations of aging and plastic deformation in polymer glasses - We study the effect of physical aging on the mechanical properties of a model polymer glass using molecular dynamics simulations. The creep compliance is determined simultaneously with the structural relaxation under a constant uniaxial load below yield at constant temperature. The model successfully captures universal features found experimentally in polymer glasses, including signatures of mechanical rejuvenation. We analyze microscopic relaxation timescales and show that they exhibit the same aging characteristics as the macroscopic creep compliance. In addition, our model indicates that the entire distribution of relaxation times scales identically with age. Despite large changes in mobility, we observe comparatively little structural change except for a weak logarithmic increase in the degree of short-range order that may be correlated to an observed decrease in aging with increasing load.

Gaseous Inner Disks - As the likely birthplaces of planets and an essential conduit for the buildup of stellar masses, inner disks are of fundamental interest in star and planet formation. Studies of the gaseous component of inner disks are of interest because of their ability to probe the dynamics, physical and chemical structure, and gas content of this region. We review the observational and theoretical developments in this field, highlighting the potential of such studies to, e.g., measure inner disk truncation radii, probe the nature of the disk accretion process, and chart the evolution in the gas content of disks. Measurements of this kind have the potential to provide unique insights on the physical processes governing star and planet formation.

Fairness Provision in the IEEE 802.11e Infrastructure Basic Service Set - Most of the deployed IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) use infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS) in which an Access Point (AP) serves as a gateway between wired and wireless domains. We present the unfairness problem between the uplink and the downlink flows of any Access Category (AC) in the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) when the default settings of the EDCA parameters are used. We propose a simple analytical model to calculate the EDCA parameter settings that achieve weighted fair resource allocation for all uplink and downlink flows. We also propose a simple model-assisted measurement-based dynamic EDCA parameter adaptation algorithm. Moreover, our dynamic solution addresses the differences in the transport layer and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer interactions of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). We show that proposed Contention Window (CW) and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limit adaptation at the AP provides fair UDP and TCP access between uplink and downlink flows of the same AC while preserving prioritization among ACs.

Radiation from Kinetic Poynting Flux Acceleration - We derive analytic formulas for the power output and critical frequency of radiation by electrons accelerated by relativistic kinetic Poynting flux, and validate these results with Particle-In-Cell plasma simulations. We find that the in-situ radiation power output and critical frequency are much below those predicted by the classical synchrotron formulae. We discuss potential astrophysical applications of these results.

A New Algebraic Structure of Finite Quantum Systems and the Modified Bessel Functions - In this paper we present a new algebraic structure (a super hyperbolic system in our terminology) for finite quantum systems, which is a generalization of the usual one in the two-level system. It fits into the so-called generalized Pauli matrices, so they play an important role in the theory. Some deep relation to the modified Bessel functions of integer order is pointed out. By taking a skillful limit finite quantum systems become quantum mechanics on the circle developed by Ohnuki and Kitakado.

The Lee-Wick Standard Model - We construct a modification of the standard model which stabilizes the Higgs mass against quadratically divergent radiative corrections, using ideas originally discussed by Lee and Wick in the context of a finite theory of quantum electrodynamics. The Lagrangian includes new higher derivative operators. We show that the higher derivative terms can be eliminated by introducing a set of auxiliary fields; this allows for convenient computation and makes the physical interpretation more transparent. Although the theory is unitary, it does not satisfy the usual analyticity conditions.

Specht modules and Kazhdan--Lusztig cells in type $B_n$ - Dipper, James and Murphy generalized the classical Specht module theory to Hecke algebras of type $B_n$. On the other hand, for any choice of a monomial order on the parameters in type $B_n$, we obtain corresponding Kazhdan--Lusztig cell modules. In this paper, we show that the Specht modules are naturally equivalent to the Kazhdan--Lusztig cell modules {\em if} we choose the dominance order on the parameters, as in the ``asymptotic case'' studied by Bonnaf\'e and the second named author. We also give examples which show that such an equivalence does not hold for other choices of monomial orders.

Growing Networks: Limit in-degree distribution for arbitrary out-degree one - We compute the stationary in-degree probability, $P_{in}(k)$, for a growing network model with directed edges and arbitrary out-degree probability. In particular, under preferential linking, we find that if the nodes have a light tail (finite variance) out-degree distribution, then the corresponding in-degree one behaves as $k^{-3}$. Moreover, for an out-degree distribution with a scale invariant tail, $P_{out}(k)\sim k^{-\alpha}$, the corresponding in-degree distribution has exactly the same asymptotic behavior only if $2<\alpha<3$ (infinite variance). Similar results are obtained when attractiveness is included. We also present some results on descriptive statistics measures %descriptive statistics such as the correlation between the number of in-going links, $D_{in}$, and outgoing links, $D_{out}$, and the conditional expectation of $D_{in}$ given $D_{out}$, and we calculate these measures for the WWW network. Finally, we present an application to the scientific publications network. The results presented here can explain the tail behavior of in/out-degree distribution observed in many real networks.

UV stable, Lorentz-violating dark energy with transient phantom era - Phantom fields with negative kinetic energy are often plagued by the vacuum quantum instability in the ultraviolet region. We present a Lorentz-violating dark energy model free from this problem and show that the crossing of the cosmological constant boundary w=-1 to the phantom equation of state is realized before reaching a de Sitter attractor. Another interesting feature is a peculiar time-dependence of the effective Newton's constant; the magnitude of this effect is naturally small but may be close to experimental limits. We also derive momentum scales of instabilities at which tachyons or ghosts appear in the infrared region around the present Hubble scale and clarify the conditions under which tachyonic instabilities do not spoil homogeneity of the present/future Universe.

Response of degree-correlated scale-free networks to stimuli - The response of degree-correlated scale-free attractor networks to stimuli is studied. We show that degree-correlated scale-free networks are robust to random stimuli as well as the uncorrelated scale-free networks, while assortative (disassortative) scale-free networks are more (less) sensitive to directed stimuli than uncorrelated networks. We find that the degree-correlation of scale-free networks makes the dynamics of attractor systems different from uncorrelated ones. The dynamics of correlated scale-free attractor networks result in the effects of degree correlation on the response to stimuli.

Shock and Release Temperatures in Molybdenum - Shock and release temperatures in Mo were calculated, taking account of heating from plastic flow predicted using the Steinberg-Guinan model. Plastic flow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this is necessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible. The temperatures obtained were significantly higher than predicted assuming ideal hydrodynamic loading. The temperatures were compared with surface emission spectrometry measurements for Mo shocked to around 60GPa and then released into vacuum or into a LiF window. Shock loading was induced by the impact of a planar projectile, accelerated by high explosive or in a gas gun. Surface velocimetry showed an elastic wave at the start of release from the shocked state; the amplitude of the elastic wave matched the prediction to around 10%, indicating that the predicted flow stress in the shocked state was reasonable. The measured temperatures were consistent with the simulations, indicating that the fraction of plastic work converted to heat was in the range 70-100% for these loading conditions.

Spectrum of the Laplacian on Quaternionic Kahler Manifolds - Let $M^{4n}$ be a complete quaternionic K\"ahler manifold with scalar curvature bounded below by $-16n(n+2)$. We get a sharp estimate for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1(M)$ of the Laplacian which is $\lambda_1(M)\le (2n+1)^2$. If the equality holds, then either $M$ has only one end, or $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}\times N$ with N given by a compact manifold. Moreover, if $M$ is of bounded curvature, $M$ is covered by the quaterionic hyperbolic space $\mathbb{QH}^n$ and $N$ is a compact quotient of the generalized Heisenberg group. When $\lambda_1(M)\ge \frac{8(n+2)}3$, we also prove that $M$ must have only one end with infinite volume.

Biased Structural Fluctuations due to Electron Wind Force - Direct correlation between temporal structural fluctuations and electron wind force is demonstrated, for the first time, by STM imaging and analysis of atomically-resolved motion on a thin film surface under large applied current (10e5 Amp/sqare cm). The magnitude of the momentum transfer between current carriers and atoms in the fluctuating structure is at least five to fifteen times (plus or minus one sigma range) larger than for freely diffusing adatoms. The corresponding changes in surface resistivity will contribute significant fluctuation signature to nanoscale electronic properties.

Dissipation of Magnetic Flux in Primordial Star Formation: From Run-away Phase to Mass Accretion Phase - We investigate the dissipation of magnetic flux in primordial star-forming clouds throughout their collapse including the run-away collapse phase as well as the accretion phase. We solve the energy equation and the non-equilibrium chemical reactions in the collapsing gas, in order to obtain the radial distribution of the ionized fraction during the collapse. As a result, we find the ionized fraction is high enough for the magnetic field to couple with the gas throughout the evolution of the cloud. This result suggests that the jet formation from protostars as well as the activation of magneto-rotational instability in the accretion disk are enabled in the presence of the cosmological seed magnetic flux proposed by Langer et al.(2003).

Teaching for transfer - Students, after they leave our care, are called to solve the diverse problems of the world, so we should teach to increase transfer: the ability to apply fundamental principles to new problems and contexts. This ability is rare. The following pages are from a workshop for faculty on designing courses that promote transfer. I discuss two design principles: to name the transferable ideas and to illustrate them with examples from diverse subjects. The discussion uses dimensional reasoning as the example of a valuable transferable idea, illustrating it with three diverse examples.

Variations of the Hidden Sector in a Realistic Intersecting Brane Model - Recently, we discussed the first example of a phenomenologically realistic intersecting D6-brane model. In this model, the gauge symmetry in the hidden sector is USp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4. However, we find that the USp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 gauge symmetry can be replaced by an U(2)_{12} gauge symmetry, and/or the USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4 gauge symmetry can be replaced by an U(2)_{34} gauge symmetry since the USp(2)^2 stacks of D6-branes contribute to the same Ramond-Ramond tadpoles as those of the U(2) stacks. Thus, there are three non-equivalent variations of the hidden sector, and the corresponding gauge symmetries are U(2)_{12} x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4, U(2)_{34} x USp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2, and U(2)_{12} x U(2)_{34}, respectively. Moreover, we study the hidden sector gauge symmetry breaking, discuss how to decouple the additional exotic particles, and briefly comment on the phenomenological consequences.

Axial Vector Tetraquark with Two s-quarks - Possibility of an axial vector isoscalar tetraquark $ud\bar{s}\bar{s}$ is discussed. If a $f_1$ meson in the mass region $1.4-1.5$ GeV consists of four quarks $ns\bar{n}\bar{s}$, the mass of the isoscalar $ud\bar{s}\bar{s}$($\vartheta^+$-meson) state with $J^P=1^+$ is expected to be lower than that of the $f_1$ meson. Within a flux-tube quark model, a possible resonant state of $ud\bar{s}\bar{s}(J^{P}=1^{+})$ is suggested to appear at $\sim$ 1.4 GeV with the width ${\cal{O}}(20\sim 50)$ MeV. We propose that the $\vartheta^+$-meson is the good candidate for the tetraquark search, which would be observed in the $K^+K^+\pi^-$ decay channel.

What is the order of 2D polymer escape transition? - An end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistons undergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-like conformation when the number of monomers in the chain, N, reaches a critical value. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain confined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation into a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on the nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions based on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded volume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length 2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the pruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM). We estimate the free energy, the end-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter, and its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N and L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average characteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical description based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good agreement with the simulation results. Both simulation results and the analytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-order phase transition.

Detecting the Most Distant (z>7) Objects with ALMA - Detecting and studying objects at the highest redshifts, out to the end of Cosmic Reionization at z>7, is clearly a key science goal of ALMA. ALMA will in principle be able to detect objects in this redshift range both from high-J (J>7) CO transitions and emission from ionized carbon, [CII], which is one of the main cooling lines of the ISM. ALMA will even be able to resolve this emission for individual targets, which will be one of the few ways to determine dynamical masses for systems in the Epoch of Reionization. We discuss some of the current problems regarding the detection and characterization of objects at high redshifts and how ALMA will eliminate most (but not all) of them.

Weak type radial convolution operators on free group - Radial convolution operators on free groups with nonnegative kernel of weak type $(2,2)$ and of restricted weak type $(2,2)$ are characterized. Estimates of weak type $(p,p)$ are obtained as well for $1<p<2.$

How Mergers May Affect The Mass Scaling Relations Between Black Holes, Galaxies, and Other Gravitationally Bound Systems - Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.

Analycity and smoothing effect for the coupled system of equations of Korteweg - de Vries type with a single point singularity - We study that a solution of the initial value problem associated for the coupled system of equations of Korteweg - de Vries type which appears as a model to describe the strong interaction of weakly nonlinear long waves, has analyticity in time and smoothing effect up to real analyticity if the initial data only has a single point singularity at $x=0.$

Smoothing properties for the higher order nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with constant coefficients - We study local and global existence and smoothing properties for the initial value problem associated to a higher order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with constant coefficients which appears as a model for propagation of pulse in optical fiber.

Double spin asymmetry in exclusive rho^0 muoproduction at COMPASS - The longitudinal double spin asymmetry A_1^rho for exclusive leptoproduction of rho^0 mesons, mu + N -> mu + N + rho, is studied using the COMPASS 2002 and 2003 data. The measured reaction is incoherent exclusive rho^0 production on polarised deuterons. The Q^2 and x dependence of A_1^rho is presented in a wide kinematical range: 3x10^-3 < Q^2 < 7 (GeV/c)^2 and 5x10^-5 < x < 0.05. The presented results are the first measurements of A_1^rho at small Q2 (Q2 < 0.1 (GeV/c)^2) and small x (x < 3x10^-3). The asymmetry is in general compatible with zero in the whole kinematical range.

High purity bright single photon source - Using cavity-enhanced non-degenerate parametric downconversion, we have built a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories. The photon state is 70% pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and reconstruction of the quantum state, revealing a clearly negative Wigner function. Furthermore, it has a spectral brightness of ~1,500 photons/s per MHz bandwidth, making it one of the brightest single photon sources available. We also investigate the correlation function of the down-converted fields using a combination of two very distinct detection methods; photon counting and homodyne measurement.

On $L^{1}$-Convergence of Fourier Series Under $MVBV$ Condition - Let $f\in L_{2\pi}$ be a real-valued even function with its Fourier series $ \frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos nx,$ and let $S_{n}(f,x), n\geq 1,$ be the $n$-th partial sum of the Fourier series. It is well-known that if the nonnegative sequence $\{a_{n}\}$ is decreasing and $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_{n}=0$, then $$ \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\Vert f-S_{n}(f)\Vert_{L}=0 {if and only if} \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_{n}\log n=0. $$ We weaken the monotone condition in this classical result to the so-called mean value bounded variation ($MVBV$) condition. The generalization of the above classical result in real-valued function space is presented as a special case of the main result in this paper which gives the $L^{1}$% -convergence of a function $f\in L_{2\pi}$ in complex space. We also give results on $L^{1}$-approximation of a function $f\in L_{2\pi}$ under the $% MVBV$ condition.

On global solution to the Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation below energy space - In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for Klein-Gordon equation with a cubic convolution nonlinearity in $\R^3$. By making use of Bourgain's method in conjunction with a precise Strichartz estimate of S.Klainerman and D.Tataru, we establish the $H^s (s<1)$ global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the cubic convolution defocusing Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation. Before arriving at the previously discussed conclusion, we obtain global solution for this non-scaling equation with small initial data in $H^{s_0}\times H^{s_0-1}$ where $s_0=\frac\gamma 6$ but not $\frac\gamma2-1$, for this equation that we consider is a subconformal equation in some sense. In doing so a number of nonlinear prior estimates are already established by using Bony's decomposition, flexibility of Klein-Gordon admissible pairs which are slightly different from that of wave equation and a commutator estimate. We establish this commutator estimate by exploiting cancellation property and utilizing Coifman and Meyer multilinear multiplier theorem. As far as we know, it seems that this is the first result on low regularity for this Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation.

Parameter estimation for power-law distributions by maximum likelihood methods - Distributions following a power-law are an ubiquitous phenomenon. Methods for determining the exponent of a power-law tail by graphical means are often used in practice but are intrinsically unreliable. Maximum likelihood estimators for the exponent are a mathematically sound alternative to graphical methods.

The Weil representation and Hecke operators for vector valued modular forms - We define Hecke operators on vector valued modular forms transforming with the Weil representation associated to a discriminant form. We describe the properties of the corresponding algebra of Hecke operators and study the action on modular forms.

On the energy spectrum of the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon Oscillator - In the present article, we describe a method of introducing the harmonic potential into the Klein-Gordon equation, leading to genuine bound states. The eigenfunctions and eigenenergies are worked out explicitly.

Band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of Landau-Pekar polarons - We consider decay of phonon condensate into phonons at photodissociation of the strong coupling large polaron (SCLP), when the charge carrier becomes free. Expression to calculate the band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of SCLP is obtained. The band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of strong-coupling large-radius polarons is a broad band with the shape determined by Poisson distribution. It can be structured or unstructured depending on the phonon dispersion since a distance between neighbouring lines comprising the band is the phonon energy. Half-width of the band is in the interval 1.3 - 1.7Ep, depending on the phonon energy. The band maximum is situated approximately at the electron energy Ephot-W-3.2Ep (where Ephot is the photon energy, W is work function), and its position does not depend on the electron wave vector direction.

From Global to Local Dynamics: Effects of the Expansion on Astrophysical Structures - We explore the effects of background cosmology on large scale structures with non-spherical symmetry by using the concept of quasi-equilibrium which allows certain internal properties (e.g. angular velocity) of the bodies to change with time. In accordance with the discovery of the accelerated phase of the universe we model the cosmological background by two representative models: the $\Lambda$CDM Model and the Chaplygin Gas Model. We compare the effects of the two models on various properties of large astrophysical objects. Different equations of state are also invoked in the investigation.

Evidence for nonmonotonic magnetic field penetration in a type-I superconductor - Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides evidence that nonlocal electrodynamics governs the magnetic field penetration in an extreme low-k superconductor. The sample is an indium film with a large elastic mean free path (11 mkm) deposited on a silicon oxide wafer. It is shown that PNR can resolve the difference between the reflected neutron spin asymmetries predicted by the local and nonlocal theories of superconductivity. The experimental data support the nonlocal theory, which predicts a nonmonotonic decay of the magnetic field.

An Achievable Rate Region for Interference Channels with Conferencing - In this paper, we propose an achievable rate region for discrete memoryless interference channels with conferencing at the transmitter side. We employ superposition block Markov encoding, combined with simultaneous superposition coding, dirty paper coding, and random binning to obtain the achievable rate region. We show that, under respective conditions, the proposed achievable region reduces to Han and Kobayashi achievable region for interference channels, the capacity region for degraded relay channels, and the capacity region for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case are given.

Electromagnetic Pulse Propagation over Nonuniform Earth Surface: Numerical Simulation - We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so called time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we introduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a nonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of finite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on the wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we develop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic wave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation costs and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by tens of thousands wavelengths.

Simulation of Graphene Nanoribbon Field Effect Transistors - We present an atomistic three-dimensional simulation of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNR-FETs), based on the self-consistent solution of the 3D Poisson and Schroedinger equation with open boundary conditions within the non-equilibrium Green's Function formalism and a tight-binding hamiltonian. With respect to carbon nanotube FETs, GNR-FETs exhibit comparable performance, reduced sensitivity on the variability of channel chirality, and similar leakage problems due to band-to-band tunneling. Acceptable transistor performance requires effective nanoribbon width of 1-2 nm, that could be obtained with periodic etching patterns or stress patterns.

Stars and the holographic upper bound on gravitational action - The holographic upper bound on entropy is applied to the gravitational action associated with the non-relativistic contraction of a nebula. A critical radius is identified, as a function of the initial radius and mass, for which the number of bits associated with the action would equal the maximum number of bits allowed to the body. The gravitational action of a typical star approximately saturates the holographic bound, perhaps suggesting a physical link between holographic principles and astrophysical processes.

New versions of Schur-Weyl duality - After reviewing classical Schur-Weyl duality, we present some other contexts which enjoy similar features, relating to Brauer algebras and classical groups.

Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory: Kinetic Potentials and Ab-Initio Local Pseudopotentials - In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of the ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external field is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate and weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying valence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free DF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local pseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic potentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization energies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density profiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full Kohn-Sham theory.

Lower bounds in some power sum problems - We study the power sum problem max_{v=1,...,m} | sum_{k=1}^n z_k^v | and by using features of Fejer kernels we give new lower bounds in the case of unimodular complex numbers z_k and m cn^2 for constants c>1.

Quantum Quenches in Extended Systems - We study in general the time-evolution of correlation functions in a extended quantum system after the quench of a parameter in the hamiltonian. We show that correlation functions in d dimensions can be extracted using methods of boundary critical phenomena in d+1 dimensions. For d=1 this allows to use the powerful tools of conformal field theory in the case of critical evolution. Several results are obtained in generic dimension in the gaussian (mean-field) approximation. These predictions are checked against the real-time evolution of some solvable models that allows also to understand which features are valid beyond the critical evolution. All our findings may be explained in terms of a picture generally valid, whereby quasiparticles, entangled over regions of the order of the correlation length in the initial state, then propagate with a finite speed through the system. Furthermore we show that the long-time results can be interpreted in terms of a generalized Gibbs ensemble. We discuss some open questions and possible future developments.

Statistical Properties of Many Particle Eigenfunctions - Wavefunction correlations and density matrices for few or many particles are derived from the properties of semiclassical energy Green functions. Universal features of fixed energy (microcanonical) random wavefunction correlation functions appear which reflect the emergence of the canonical ensemble as the number of particles approaches infinity. This arises through a little known asymptotic limit of Bessel functions. Constraints due to symmetries, boundaries, and collisions between particles can be included.

The power of choice in network growth - The "power of choice" has been shown to radically alter the behavior of a number of randomized algorithms. Here we explore the effects of choice on models of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomly chosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever one of these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from the root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when k=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree. For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the root of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a traveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the smallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random graph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with degree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the contact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a power law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an exponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a power law over a wide range of degrees.

Terahertz Time-Domain Magnetospectroscopy of a High-Mobility Two-Dimensional Electron Gas - We have observed cyclotron resonance in a high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas by using the techniques of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy combined with magnetic fields. From this, we calculate the real and imaginary parts of the diagonal elements of the magnetoconductivity tensor, which in turn allows us to extract the concentration, effective mass, and scattering time of the electrons in the sample. We demonstrate the utility of ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy, which can recover the true linewidth of cyclotron resonance in a high-mobility ($>{10}^{6} \mathrm{cm^{2} V^{-1} s^{-1}}$) sample without being affected by the saturation effect.

Coloring ordinals by reals - We study combinatorial principles we call Homogeneity Principle HP(\kappa) and Injectivity Principle IP(\kappa,\lambda) for regular \kappa>\aleph_1 and \lambda\leq\kappa which are formulated in terms of coloring the ordinals <\kappa by reals.

Evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations - BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties. RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral network. CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that exist in large populations.

An algebraic generalization of Kripke structures - The Kripke semantics of classical propositional normal modal logic is made algebraic via an embedding of Kripke structures into the larger class of pointed stably supported quantales. This algebraic semantics subsumes the traditional algebraic semantics based on lattices with unary operators, and it suggests natural interpretations of modal logic, of possible interest in the applications, in structures that arise in geometry and analysis, such as foliated manifolds and operator algebras, via topological groupoids and inverse semigroups. We study completeness properties of the quantale based semantics for the systems K, T, K4, S4, and S5, in particular obtaining an axiomatization for S5 which does not use negation or the modal necessity operator. As additional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the logic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.

Origin of the 60K plateau in YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x - A model for charge transfer mechanism in YBa2Cu3O6+x high-Tc cuprate based on critical chain length concept is proposed to account for 60K and 90K plateaus in Tc(x) dependence. It has been shown, when the statistics of CuO chain formation was described in terms of two dimensional asymmetric next-to-nearest neighbor Ising (ASYNNNI) model, that at any constant temperature below the top of OII phase there exists a uniquely defined value of critical chain length lcr(T) that yields a constant doping p(x)=const over the regime of OII phase (related to 60K plateau of Tc(x)), while 90K plateau coincides with the monotonously increasing p(x) over optimal doping level p=0.16 in the regime of OI phase. Short length chains (l<lcr(T)), together with the first lcr(T)-2 holes in longer chains (l>lcr(T)), are taken as not capable of attracting electrons from CuO2 planes.. It is shown that only a part (41%) of the remaining l-lcr(T)+1 holes in the long chains can capture electrons. The results obtained indicate that the ASYNNNI model and two-plateaus-like behavior of Tc(x) in YBa2Cu3O6+x are closely connected.

N-homogeneous superalgebras - We develop the theory of N-homogeneous algebras in a super setting, with particular emphasis on the Koszul property. To any Hecke operator on a vector superspace, we associate certain superalgebras and generalizing the ordinary symmetric and Grassmann algebra, respectively. We prove that these algebras are N-Koszul. For the special case where the Hecke operator is the ordinary supersymmetry, we derive an $N$-generalized super-version of MacMahon's classical "master theorem".

First and second sound modes at finite temperature in trapped Fermi gases from BCS to BEC - We determine the temperature $T$ dependence of first and second sound mode frequencies for trapped Fermi gases undergoing BCS to Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. Our results are based on the two fluid equations in conjunction with a microscopic calculation of thermodynamical variables. As in experiment and at unitarity, we show that the lowest radial breathing mode is $T$ independent. At finite $T$, higher order breathing modes strongly mix with second sound. Their complex $T$ dependence should provide an alternative way of measuring the transition temperature, $T_c$.

Computation and visualization of Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries: non-monotonic lateral forces and failure of proximity-force approximations - We present a method of computing Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries, with any desired accuracy, that can directly exploit the efficiency of standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques. Using the simplest possible finite-difference implementation of this approach, we obtain both agreement with past results for cylinder-plate geometries, and also present results for new geometries. In particular, we examine a piston-like problem involving two dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls, in two and three dimensions, respectively, and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic changes in the force due to these lateral walls.

Axioms for a local Reidemeister trace in fixed point and coincidence theory on differentiable manifolds - We give axioms which characterize the local Reidemeister trace for orientable differentiable manifolds. The local Reidemeister trace in fixed point theory is already known, and we provide both uniqueness and existence results for the local Reidemeister trace in coincidence theory.

On (n+2)-dimensional n-Lie algebras - I show that an (n+2)-dimensional n-Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field must have a subalgeba of codimension 1.

Elastic properties of vanadium pentoxide aggregates and topological defects - We study the aqueous solution of vanadium pentoxide by using topology methods. The experiments by Zocher, Kaznacheev, and Dogic exhibited, that in the sol phases of $V_2O_5-H_2O$, the tactoid droplets of $V_2O_5$ can coalesce. In the magnetic field, this effect is associated with a gauge field action, viz. we consider coalescence (in the topologically more convenient term, "junction") of droplets as annihilation of topological defects, concerning with the tactoid geometry. We have shown, that in the magnetic field, the tactoid junction is mainly caused by non-Abelian monopoles (vortons), whereas the Abelian defects almost do not annihilate. Taking into account this annihilation mechanism, the estimations of time-aging of the $V_2O_5-H_2O$ sols may be specified

Non-Associativity of Lorentz Transformation and Associative Reflection Symmetric Transformation - Each of the two moving observers observes the relative velocity of the other. The two velocities should be equal and opposite. We have shown that this relativistic requirement is not fulfilled by Lorentz transformation. We have also shown that the reason is that Lorentz transformation is not associative. Reciprocal symmetric transformation is associative and fulfills relativistic requirements.

Jamming dynamics in grain mixtures : An extended hydrodynamic approach - We study jamming in granular mixtures from the novel point of view of extended hydrodynamics. Using a hard sphere binary mixture model we predict that a few large grains are expected to get caged more effectively in a matrix of small grains compared to a few small grains in a matrix of larger ones. A similar effect has been experimentally seen in the context of colloidal mixtures.

Path Distinguishability in Double Scattering of Light by Atoms - Wave-particle duality finds a natural application for electrons or light propagating in disordered media where coherent corrections to transport are given by two-wave interference. For scatterers with internal degrees of freedom, these corrections are observed to be much smaller than would be expected for structureless scatterers. By examining the basic example of the scattering of one photon by two spin-1/2 atoms--a case-study for coherent backscattering--we demonstrate that the loss of interference strength is associated with which-path information stored by the scattering atoms.

Constraints on transmission, dispersion, and density of states in dielectric multilayers and stepwise potential barriers with arbitrary layer arrangement - Normal-incidence transmission and dispersion properties of optical multilayers and one-dimensional stepwise potential barriers in the non-tunneling regime are analytically investigated. The optical paths of every constituent layer in a multilayer structure, as well as the parameters of every step of the stepwise potential barrier, are constrained by a generalized quarter-wave condition. No other restrictions on the structure geometry is imposed, i.e., the layers are arranged arbitrarily. We show that the density of states (DOS) spectra of the multilayer or barrier in question are subject to integral conservation rules similar to the Barnett-Loudon sum rule but ocurring within a finite frequency or energy interval. In the optical case, these frequency intervals are regular. For the potential barriers, only non-periodic energy intervals can be present in the spectrum of any given structure, and only if the parameters of constituent potential steps are properly chosen. Abstract The integral conservation relations derived analytically have also been verified numerically. The relations can be used in dispersion-engineered multilayer-based devices, e.g., ultrashort pulse compressors or ultracompact optical delay lines, as well as to design multiple-quantum-well electronic heterostructures with engineered DOS.

Electromagnetic Casimir densities for a wedge with a coaxial cylindrical shell - Vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field are investigated for the geometry of a wedge with a coaxal cylindrical boundary. All boundaries are assumed to be perfectly conducting and both regions inside and outside the shell are considered. By using the generalized Abel-Plana formula, the vacuum expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of two terms. The first one corresponds to the geometry of the wedge without the cylindrical shell and the second term is induced by the presence of the shell. The vacuum energy density induced by the shell is negative for the interior region and is positive for the exterior region. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum expectation values are investigated in various limiting cases. It is shown that the vacuum forces acting on the wedge sides due to the presence of the cylindrical boundary are always attractive.

Progenitors of Long Gamma-ray Bursts - Pinpointing the progenitors of long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) remains an extremely important question, although it is now clear that at least a fraction of LGRBs originate in the core collapse of massive stars in type Ic supernovae, the pathways to the production of these stars, and their initial masses, remain uncertain. Rotation is thought to be vital in the creation of LGRBs, and it is likely that black hole creation is also necessary. We suggest that these two constraints can be met if the GRB progenitors are very massive stars (>20 solar masses) and are formed in tight binary systems. Using simple models we compare the predictions of this scenario with observations and find that the location of GRBs on their host galaxies are suggestive of main-sequence masses in excess of 20 solar masses, while 50% of the known compact binary systems may have been sufficiently close to have had the necessary rotation rates for GRB creation. Thus, massive stars in compact binaries are a likely channel for at least some fraction of LGRBs.

Causal vs. Analytic constraints on anomalous quartic gauge couplings - We derive one loop constraints on the anomalous quartic gauge couplings using a general non-forward dispersion relation for the elastic scattering amplitude of two longitudinally polarized vector bosons. We compare this result with another one derived by the assumption that the underlying theory satisfies the causality principle of Special Relativity and show that this latter is more constraining.

Classical Information Capacity of the Bosonic Broadcast Channel - We show that when coherent-state encoding is employed in conjunction with coherent detection, the Bosonic broadcast channel is equivalent to a classical degraded Gaussian broadcast channel whose capacity region is dual to that of the classical Gaussian multiple-access channel. We further show that if a minimum output-entropy conjecture holds true, then the ultimate classical information capacity of the Bosonic broadcast channel can be achieved by a coherent-state encoding. We provide some evidence in support of the conjecture.

Interplay of Anisotropy and Disorder in the Doping-Dependent Melting and Glass Transitions of Vortices in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ - We study the oxygen doping dependence of the equilibrium first-order melting and second-order glass transitions of vortices in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Doping affects both anisotropy and disorder. Anisotropy scaling is shown to collapse the melting lines only where thermal fluctuations are dominant. Yet, in the region where disorder breaks that scaling, the glass lines are still collapsed. A quantitative fit to melting and replica symmetry breaking lines of a 2D Ginzburg-Landau model further reveals that disorder amplitude weakens with doping, but to a lesser degree than thermal fluctuations, enhancing the relative role of disorder.

Growth window and possible mechanism of millimeter-thick single-walled carbon nanotube forests - Our group recently reproduced the water-assisted growth method, so-called "super growth", of millimeter-thick single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) forests by using C2H4/ H2/ H2O/ Ar reactant gas and Fe/ Al2O3 catalyst. In this current work, a parametric study was carried out on both reaction and catalyst conditions. Results revealed that a thin Fe catalyst layer (about 0.5 nm) yielded rapid growth of SWNTs only when supported on Al2O3, and that Al2O3 support enhanced the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. The growth window for the rapid SWNT growth was narrow, however. Optimum amount of added H2O increased the SWNT growth rate but further addition of H2O degraded both the SWNT growth rate and quality. Addition of H2 was also essential for rapid SWNT growth, but again, further addition decreased both the SWNT growth rate and quality. Because Al2O3 catalyzes hydrocarbon reforming, Al2O3 support possibly enhances the SWNT growth rate by supplying the carbon source to the catalyst nanoparticles. The origin of the narrow window for rapid SWNT growth will also be discussed.

Nonlocal interactions versus viscosity in turbulence - It is shown that nonlocal interactions determine energy spectrum in isotropic turbulence at small Reynolds numbers. It is also shown that for moderate Reynolds numbers the bottleneck effect is determined by the same nonlocal interactions. Role of the large and small scales covariance at the nonlocal interactions and in energy balance has been investigated. A possible hydrodynamic mechanism of the nonlocal solution instability at large scales has been briefly discussed. A quantitative relationship between effective strain of the nonlocal interactions and viscosity has been found. All results are supported by comparison with the data of experiments and numerical simulations.

Quantum radiative corrections to slow-roll inflation - We consider the nonminimally coupled lambda phi^4 scalar field theory in de Sitter space and construct the renormalization group improved renormalized effective theory at the one-loop level. Based on the corresponding quantum Friedmann equation and the scalar field equation of motion, we calculate the quantum radiative corrections to the scalar spectral index n_s, gravitational wave spectral index n_g and the ratio r of tensor to scalar perturbations. When compared with the standard (tree-level) values, we find that the quantum contributions are suppressed by lambda N^2 where N denotes the number of e-foldings. Hence there is an N^2 enhancement with respect to the naive expectation, which is due to the infrared enhancement of scalar vacuum fluctuations characterising de Sitter space. Since observations constrain lambda to be very small lambda ~ 10^(-12) and N ~ 50-60, the quantum corrections in this inflationary model are unobservably small.

Ab initio wavefunction based methods for excited states in solids: correlation corrections to the band structure of ionic oxides - Ab initio wavefunction based methods are applied to the study of electron correlation effects on the band structure of oxide systems. We choose MgO as a prototype closed-shell ionic oxide. Our analysis is based on a local Hamiltonian approach and performed on finite fragments cut from the infinite solid. Localized Wannier functions and embedding potentials are obtained from prior periodic Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations. We investigate the role of various electron correlation effects in reducing the HF band gap and modifying the band widths. On-site and nearest-neighbor charge relaxation as well as long-range polarization effects are calculated. Whereas correlation effects are essential for computing accurate band gaps, we found that they produce smaller changes on the HF band widths, at least for this material. Surprisingly, a broadening effect is obtained for the O 2p valence bands. The ab initio data are in good agreement with the energy gap and band width derived from thermoreflectance and x-ray photoemission experiments. The results show that the wavefunction based approach applied here allows for well controlled approximations and a transparent identification of the microscopic processes which determine the electronic band structure.

Abundances in intermediate-mass AGB stars undergoing third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning - High dispersion near-infrared spectra have been taken of seven highly-evolved, variable, intermediate-mass (4-6 Msun) AGB stars in the LMC and SMC in order to look for C, N and O variations that are expected to arise from third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. The pulsation of the objects has been modelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have been performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two stars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared with the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very large N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first observational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen by the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in intermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the remaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had strong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the line cores and made abundance determination impossible. The latter occurrence allows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observations should be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible.

A practical guide to stochastic simulations of reaction-diffusion processes - A practical introduction to stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion processes is presented. No prior knowledge of stochastic simulations is assumed. The methods are explained using illustrative examples. The article starts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of chemical reactions. Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular diffusion are given. Finally, basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are presented. The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic models are explained and basic mathematical tools (e.g. chemical master equation) are presented. The article concludes with an overview of more advanced methods and problems.

Non-linear electromagnetic response of graphene - It is shown that the massless energy spectrum of electrons and holes in graphene leads to the strongly non-linear electromagnetic response of this system. We predict that the graphene layer, irradiated by electromagnetic waves, emits radiation at higher frequency harmonics and can work as a frequency multiplier. The operating frequency of the graphene frequency multiplier can lie in a broad range from microwaves to the infrared.

Ellipsoidal Oscillations Induced by Substellar Companions: A Prospect for the Kepler Mission - Hundreds of substellar companions to solar-type stars will be discovered with the Kepler satellite. Kepler's extreme photometric precision gives access to low-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physical processes. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the tidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression for the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula works extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convection zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\ga$10 times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white dwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal lightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggest that ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable from as many as ~100 of the 10^5 Kepler target stars. (Abridged)

Motor driven microtubule shape fluctuations - force from within the lattice - We develop a general theory of microtubule (MT) deformations by molecular motors generating internal force doublets within the MT lattice. We describe two basic internal excitations, the S and V shape, and compare them with experimental observations from literature. We explain the special role of tubulin vacancies and the dramatic deformation amplifying effect observed for katanin acting at positions of defects. Experimentally observed shapes are used to determine the ratio of MT shear and stretch moduli ($\approx 6\times10^{-5}$) and to estimate the forces induced in the MT lattice by katanin (10's of pN). For many motors acting on a single MT we derive expressions for the end-to-end distance reduction and provide criteria for dominance of this new effect over thermal fluctuations. We conclude that molecular motors if acting cooperatively can ''animate'' MTs from within the lattice and induce slack even without cross-bridging to other structures, a scenario very much reminiscent of the motor driven axoneme.

Bone Cancer Rates in Dinosaurs Compared with Modern Vertebrates - Data on the prevalence of bone cancer in dinosaurs is available from past radiological examination of preserved bones. We statistically test this data for consistency with rates extrapolated from information on bone cancer in modern vertebrates, and find that there is no evidence of a different rate. Thus, this test provides no support for a possible role of ionizing radiation in the K-T extinction event.

Effective Lagrangian for the $\chi^{+}_j \chi^{-}_kH^{0}_l$ interaction in the minimal supersymmetric standard model and neutral Higgs decays - We extend previous analyses of the supersymmetric loop correction to the neutral Higgs couplings to include the coupling $\chi^{+}_j \chi^{-}_kH^{0}_l$. The analysis completes the previous analyses where similar corrections were computed for the $\bar{\tau} \tau H^{0}_l$, $\bar{b} b H^{0}_l$, $\bar{c} c H^{0}_l$ and for $\bar{t} t H^{0}_l$ couplings within the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The effective one loop Lagrangian is then applied to the computation of the neutral Higgs decays. The sizes of the supersymmetric loop corrections of the neutral Higgs decay widths into $\chi^{+}_i \chi^{-}_j$ ($i=1,2$; $j=1,2$) are investigated and the supersymmetric loop correction is found to be in the range of $7\sim15%$ in significant regions of the parameter space. By including the loop corrections of the other decay channels $\bar{b} b$, $\bar{t} t$, $\bar{\tau} \tau$, $\bar{c} c$, and $\chi^0_i \chi^0_j$ ($i=1-4$; $j=1-4$), the corrections to branching ratios for $H^{0}_l\to \chi^{+}_i \chi^{-}_j$ can reach as high as 40%. The effects of CP phases on the branching ratio are also investigated.

Finite Representations of the braid group commutator subgroup - We study the representations of the commutator subgroup K_{n} of the braid group B_{n} into a finite group . This is done through a symbolic dynamical system. Some experimental results enable us to compute the number of subgroups of K_{n} of a given (finite) index, and, as a by-product, to recover the well known fact that every representation of K_{n} into S_{r}, with n > r, must be trivial.

Thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids and implications for the magnitude of the Yarkovsky effect - Thermal inertia determines the temperature distribution over the surface of an asteroid and therefore governs the magnitude the Yarkovsky effect. The latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range. Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the km-size range is 200 $\pm$ 40 J m&#8722;2 s&#8722;0.5 K&#8722;1. Furthermore, we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is a more complex function than the generally adopted D^(&#8722;1) dependence, and that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than generally assumed. We discuss how this fact may help to explain the small difference in the slope of the size distribution of km-sized NEAs and main-belt asteroids.

Solutions of certain fractional kinetic equations and a fractional diffusion equation - In view of the usefulness and importance of the kinetic equation in certain physical problems, the authors derive the explicit solution of a fractional kinetic equation of general character, that unifies and extends earlier results. Further, an alternative shorter method based on a result developed by the authors is given to derive the solution of a fractional diffusion equation.

Strong enhancement of transport by interaction on contact links - Strong repulsive interactions within a one dimensional Fermi system in a two-probe configuration normally lead to a reduced off-resonance conductance. We show that if the repulsive interaction extends to the contact regions, a strong increase of the conductance may occur, even for systems where one would expect to find a reduced conductance. An essential ingredient in our calculations is a momentum-space representation of the leads, which allows a high energy resolution. Further, we demonstrate that these results are independent of the high-energy cutoff and that the relevant scale is set by the Fermi velocity.

Quantum Filtering of Optical Coherent States - We propose and experimentally demonstrate non-destructive and noiseless removal (filtering) of vacuum states from an arbitrary set of coherent states of continuous variable systems. Errors i.e. vacuum states in the quantum information are diagnosed through a weak measurement, and on that basis, probabilistically filtered out. We consider three different filters based on on/off detection phase stabilized and phase randomized homodyne detection. We find that on/off etection, optimal in the ideal theoretical setting, is superior to the homodyne strategy in a practical setting.

Interpreting and predicting the yield of transit surveys: Giant planets in the OGLE fields - Transiting extrasolar planets are now discovered jointly by photometric surveys and by radial velocimetry. We want to determine whether the different data sets are compatible between themselves and with models of the evolution of extrasolar planets. We simulate directly a population of stars corresponding to the OGLE transit survey and assign them planetary companions based on radial velocimetry discoveries. We use a model of the evolution and structure of giant planets assuming a variable fraction of heavy elements. The output list of detectable planets of the simulations is compared to the real detections. We confirm that the radial velocimetry and photometric survey data sets are compatible within the statistical errors, assuming that planets with periods between 1 and 2 days are approximately 5 times less frequent than planets with periods between 2 and 5 days. We show that evolution models fitting present observational constraints predict a lack of small giant planets with large masses. We also identify distinct populations of planets: those with short periods (P < 10d) are only found in orbit around metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] > -0.07. We further confirm the relative absence of low-mass giant planets at small orbital distances.

Global Disk Oscillation Modes in Cataclysmic Variables and Other Newtonian Accretors - Diskoseismology, the theoretical study of small adiabatic hydrodynamical global perturbations of geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks around black holes (and other compact objects), is a potentially powerful probe of the gravitational field. For instance, the frequencies of the normal mode oscillations can be used to determine the elusive angular momentum parameter of the black hole. The general formalism developed by diskoseismologists for relativistic systems can be readily applied to the Newtonian case of cataclysmic variables (CVs). Some of these systems (e.g., the dwarf nova SS Cygni) show rapid oscillations in the UV with periods of tens of seconds and high coherence. In this paper, we assess the possibility that these dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs) are diskoseismic modes. Besides its importance in investigating the physical origin of DNOs, the present work could help us to answer the following question. To what extent are the similarities in the oscillation phenomenology of CVs and X-ray binaries (XRBs) indicative of a common physical mechanism?

Quantum molecular dynamics study of the pressure dependence of the ammonia inversion transition - The mechanism of the shift, broadening and quenching of the ammonia inversion frequency with gas pressure has been a problem of lively interest for over seventy years. A simple quantum model of the ammonia molecule perturbed by collisions with ideal gas molecules displays the essential features of the experimental data for NH3 and for ND3. The model does not display the behaviour expected from theories of quantum localisation such as quantum state diffusion and decoherence. On the other hand, models of perturbed classical oscillators do display similar behaviour to our model. The quenching of the ammonia inversion transition cannot therefore be interpreted as spatial localisation of the wavefunction.

Relative Rigidity, Quasiconvexity and C-Complexes - We introduce and study the notion of relative rigidity for pairs $(X,\JJ)$ where 1) $X$ is a hyperbolic metric space and $\JJ$ a collection of quasiconvex sets 2) $X$ is a relatively hyperbolic group and $\JJ$ the collection of parabolics 3) $X$ is a higher rank symmetric space and $\JJ$ an equivariant collection of maximal flats Relative rigidity can roughly be described as upgrading a uniformly proper map between two such $\JJ$'s to a quasi-isometry between the corresponding $X$'s. A related notion is that of a $C$-complex which is the adaptation of a Tits complex to this context. We prove the relative rigidity of the collection of pairs $(X, \JJ)$ as above. This generalises a result of Schwarz for symmetric patterns of geodesics in hyperbolic space. We show that a uniformly proper map induces an isomorphism of the corresponding $C$-complexes. We also give a couple of characterizations of quasiconvexity. of subgroups of hyperbolic groups on the way.

Theory of enhanced second-harmonic generation by the quadrupole-dipole hybrid exciton - We report calculated substantial enhancement of the second harmonic generation (SHG) in cuprous oxide crystals resonantly hybridized with an appropriate organic material (DCM2:CA:PS 'solid-state solvent'). The quadrupole origin of the inorganic part of the quadrupole-dipole hybrid provides inversion symmetry breaking and the organic part contributes to the oscillator strength of the hybrid. We show that the enhancement of the SHG, compared to bulk cuprous oxide crystal, is proportional to the ratio of the DCM2 dipole moment and the effective dipole moment of the quadrupole transitions in the cuprous oxide. It is also inversely proportional to the line-width of the hybrid and bulk excitons. The enhancement may be regulated by adjusting the organic blend (mutual concentration of the DCM2 and CA part of the solvent) and pumping conditions(varying the angle of incidence in case of optical pumping or populating the minimum of the lower branch of the hybrid in case of electrical pumping).

Error Estimation and Atomistic-Continuum Adaptivity for the Quasicontinuum Approximation of a Frenkel-Kontorova Model - We propose and analyze a goal-oriented a posteriori error estimator for the atomistic-continuum modeling error in the quasicontinuum method. Based on this error estimator, we develop an algorithm which adaptively determines the atomistic and continuum regions to compute a quantity of interest to within a given tolerance. We apply the algorithm to the computation of the structure of a crystallographic defect described by a Frenkel-Kontorova model and present the results of numerical experiments. The numerical results show that our method gives an efficient estimate of the error and a nearly optimal atomistic-continuum modeling strategy.

Blind Identification of Distributed Antenna Systems with Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets - In spatially distributed multiuser antenna systems, the received signal contains multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) arising from mismatch between the oscillators of transmitters and receivers. This results in a time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated at the receiver before symbol recovery. In this paper, a new approach for blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery is proposed. The received base-band signal is over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system estimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled versions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a distinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO can be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated MIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to initialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually linked with PLL.

The Distribution of the first Eigenvalue Spacing at the Hard Edge of the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble - The distribution function for the first eigenvalue spacing in the Laguerre unitary ensemble of finite rank random matrices is found in terms of a Painlev\'e V system, and the solution of its associated linear isomonodromic system. In particular it is characterised by the polynomial solutions to the isomonodromic equations which are also orthogonal with respect to a deformation of the Laguerre weight. In the scaling to the hard edge regime we find an analogous situation where a certain Painlev\'e \IIId system and its associated linear isomonodromic system characterise the scaled distribution. We undertake extensive analytical studies of this system and use this knowledge to accurately compute the distribution and its moments for various values of the parameter $ a $. In particular choosing $ a=\pm 1/2 $ allows the first eigenvalue spacing distribution for random real orthogonal matrices to be computed.

Second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids: Relativistic effects of pressure, multi-component, curvature, and rotation - We present general relativistic correction terms appearing in Newton's gravity to the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids. In our previous work we have shown that to the second-order perturbations, the density and velocity perturbation equations of general relativistic zero-pressure, irrotational, single-component fluid in a flat background coincide exactly with the ones known in Newton's theory. Here, we present the general relativistic second-order correction terms arising due to (i) pressure, (ii) multi-component, (iii) background curvature, and (iv) rotation. In case of multi-component zero-pressure, irrotational fluids under the flat background, we effectively do not have relativistic correction terms, thus the relativistic result again coincides with the Newtonian ones. In the other three cases we generally have pure general relativistic correction terms. In case of pressure, the relativistic corrections appear even in the level of background and linear perturbation equations. In the presence of background curvature, or rotation, pure relativistic correction terms directly appear in the Newtonian equations of motion of density and velocity perturbations to the second order. In the small-scale limit (far inside the horizon), relativistic equations including the rotation coincide with the ones in Newton's gravity.

Highly turbulent solutions of LANS-alpha and their LES potential - We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model (LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have previously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.

Reentrant Orbital Order and the True Ground State of LaSr2Mn2O7 - Contrary to conventional wisdom, our purified La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7 crystals exhibit CE-type orbital and charge order as the low-temperature ground state for a hole doping level h = 0.5. For small deviations from h = 0.5, the high temperature CE phase is replaced at low temperatures by an A-type antiferromagnet without coexistence. Larger deviations result in a lack of CE order at any temperature. Thus, small inhomogeneities in cation or oxygen composition could explain why others commonly see this reentrance with coexistence.

Addendum: A Classification of Plane Symmetric Kinematic Self-similar Solutions - In our recent paper, we classified plane symmetric kinematic self-similar perfect fluid and dust solutions of the second, zeroth and infinite kinds. However, we have missed some solutions during the process. In this short communication, we add up those missing solutions. We have found a total of seven solutions, out of which five turn out to be independent and cannot be found in the earlier paper

Weak non-linearities and cluster states - We propose a scalable approach to building cluster states of matter qubits using coherent states of light. Recent work on the subject relies on the use of single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes have a low initial success probability and low detector efficiencies cause a serious blowup in resources. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and highly efficient measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple homodyne measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost and the time scaling, showing how these can be vastly improved with access to this new probability range.

A discriminating probe of gravity at cosmological scales - The standard cosmological model is based on general relativity and includes dark matter and dark energy. An important prediction of this model is a fixed relationship between the gravitational potentials responsible for gravitational lensing and the matter overdensity. Alternative theories of gravity often make different predictions for this relationship. We propose a set of measurements which can test the lensing/matter relationship, thereby distinguishing between dark energy/matter models and models in which gravity differs from general relativity. Planned optical, infrared and radio galaxy and lensing surveys will be able to measure $E_G$, an observational quantity whose expectation value is equal to the ratio of the Laplacian of the Newtonian potentials to the peculiar velocity divergence, to percent accuracy. We show that this will easily separate alternatives such as $\Lambda$CDM, DGP, TeVeS and $f(R)$ gravity.

The Loewner driving function of trajectory arcs of quadratic differentials - We obtain a first order differential equation for the driving function of the chordal Loewner differential equation in the case where the domain is slit by a curve which is a trajectory arc of certain quadratic differentials. In particular this includes the case when the curve is a path on the square, triangle or hexagonal lattice in the upper halfplane or, indeed, in any domain with boundary on the lattice. We also demonstrate how we use this to calculate the driving function numerically. Equivalent results for other variants of the Loewner differential equation are also obtained: Multiple slits in the chordal Loewner differential equation and the radial Loewner differential equation. The method also works for other versions of the Loewner differential equation. The proof of our formula uses a generalization of Schwarz-Christoffel mapping to domains bounded by trajectory arcs of rotations of a given quadratic differential that is of interest in its own right.

On the measurement problem for a two-level quantum system - A geometric approach to quantum mechanics with unitary evolution and non-unitary collapse processes is developed. In this approach the Schrodinger evolution of a quantum system is a geodesic motion on the space of states of the system furnished with an appropriate Riemannian metric. The measuring device is modeled by a perturbation of the metric. The process of measurement is identified with a geodesic motion of state of the system in the perturbed metric. Under the assumption of random fluctuations of the perturbed metric, the Born rule for probabilities of collapse is derived. The approach is applied to a two-level quantum system to obtain a simple geometric interpretation of quantum commutators, the uncertainty principle and Planck's constant. In light of this, a lucid analysis of the double-slit experiment with collapse and an experiment on a pair of entangled particles is presented.

Global-String and Vortex Superfluids in a Supersymmetric Scenario - The main goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of finding the supersymmetric version of the U(1)-global string model which behaves as a vortex-superfluid. To describe the superfluid phase, we introduce a Lorentz-symmetry breaking background that, in an approach based on supersymmetry, leads to a discussion on the relation between the violation of Lorentz symmetry and explicit soft supersymmetry breakings. We also study the relation between the string configuration and the vortex-superfluid phase. In the framework we settle down in terms of superspace and superfields, we actually establish a duality between the vortex degrees of freedom and the component fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield. We make also considerations about the fermionic excitations that may appear in connection with the vortex formation.

Identities for number series and their reciprocals: Dirac delta function approach - Dirac delta function (delta-distribution) approach can be used as efficient method to derive identities for number series and their reciprocals. Applying this method, a simple proof for identity relating prime counting function (pi-function) and logarithmic integral (Li-function) can be obtained.

Light quark masses from unquenched lattice QCD - We calculate the light meson spectrum and the light quark masses by lattice QCD simulation, treating all light quarks dynamically and employing the Iwasaki gluon action and the nonperturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson quark action. The calculations are made at the squared lattice spacings at an equal distance a^2~0.005, 0.01 and 0.015 fm^2, and the continuum limit is taken assuming an O(a^2) discretization error. The light meson spectrum is consistent with experiment. The up, down and strange quark masses in the \bar{MS} scheme at 2 GeV are \bar{m}=(m_{u}+m_{d})/2=3.55^{+0.65}_{-0.28} MeV and m_s=90.1^{+17.2}_{-6.1} MeV where the error includes statistical and all systematic errors added in quadrature. These values contain the previous estimates obtained with the dynamical u and d quarks within the error.

The Chow ring of the moduli space and its related homogeneous space of bundles on P^2 with charge 1 - For an algebraically closed field K with ch K \not = 2, we determine the Chow ring of the moduli space of holomorphic bundles on a projective plane with the structure group SO(n,K) and half the first Pontryagin index being equal to 1, each of which is trivial on a fixed line and has a fixed holomorphic trivialization there.

Entanglement condition via su(2) and su(1,1) algebra using Schr{\"o}dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation - The Schr{\"o}dinger-Robertson inequality generally provides a stronger bound on the product of uncertainties for two noncommuting observables than the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, and as such, it can yield a stricter separability condition in conjunction with partial transposition. In this paper, using the Schr{\"o}dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation, the separability condition previously derived from the su(2) and the su(1,1) algebra is made stricter and refined to a form invariant with respect to local phase shifts. Furthermore, a linear optical scheme is proposed to test this invariant separability condition.

Additional Explanatory Notes on the Analytic Proof of the Finite Generation of the Canonical Ring - This set of notes provides some additional explanatory material on the analytic proof of the finite generation of the canonical ring for a compact complex algebraic manifold of general type.

Tait's conjectures and odd crossing number amphicheiral knots - We give a brief historical overview of the Tait conjectures, made 120 years ago in the course of his pioneering work in tabulating the simplest knots, and solved a century later using the Jones polynomial. We announce the solution, again based on a substantial study of the Jones polynomial, of one (possibly his last remaining?) problem of Tait, with the construction of amphicheiral knots of almost all odd crossing numbers. An application to the non-triviality problem for the Jones polynomial is also outlined.

A revisit of the papers on the theory of relativity: Reconsideration of the hypothesis of ether-dragging - This paper revisits previous papers related to the theory of relativity. Afterwards, a reconsideration of the hypothesis of ether-dragging is discussed. The ether is compatible with the theory of relativity and historical experiments; this paper explains the Michelson-Morley experiment using the ether-dragging hypothesis without the orthodox interpretation that the speed c is a fixed constant in terms of any system of inertial coordinates.

The ideal-valued index for a dihedral group action, and mass partition by two hyperplanes - We compute the complete Fadell-Husseini index of the 8 element dihedral group D_8 acting on S^d \times S^d, both for F_2 and for integer coefficients. This establishes the complete goup cohomology lower bounds for the two hyperplane case of Gr"unbaum's 1960 mass partition problem: For which d and j can any j arbitrary measures be cut into four equal parts each by two suitably-chosen hyperplanes in R^d? In both cases, we find that the ideal bounds are not stronger than previously established bounds based on one of the maximal abelian subgroups of D_8.

A new method of alpha ray measurement using a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer - We propose a new method of alpha($\alpha$)-ray measurement that detects helium atoms with a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer(QMS). A demonstration is undertaken with a plastic-covered $^{241}$Am $\alpha$-emitting source to detect $\alpha$-rays stopped in the capsule. We successfully detect helium atoms that diffuse out of the capsule by accumulating them for one to 20 hours in a closed chamber. The detected amount is found to be proportional to the accumulation time. Our method is applicable to probe $\alpha$-emitting radioactivity in bulk material.

Magnetorotational Collapse of Population III Stars - We perform a series of two-dimensional magnetorotational core-collapse simulations of Pop III stars. Changing the initial distributions of rotation and magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19 models. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic fields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the black-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the microphysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the neutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves if the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12}$ G. We point out that the black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

Hyperfine Quenching of the $4s4p ^{3}P_{0}$ Level in Zn-like Ions - In this paper, we used the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method to compute with high precision the influence of the hyperfine interaction on the $[Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p ^3P_0$ level lifetime in Zn-like ions for stable and some quasi-stable isotopes of nonzero nuclear spin between Z=30 and Z=92. The influence of this interaction on the $[Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p ^3P_1 - [Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p ^3P_0$ separation energy is also calculated for the same ions.

R-matrices in Rime - We replace the ice Ansatz on matrix solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation by a weaker condition which we call "rime". Rime solutions include the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo R-matrix. Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime Ansatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call "strict rime". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective vector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix by a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the components of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime Ansatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to a quantization of a classical "boundary" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and Giaquinto. We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, as a by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformly described in a rime form. We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezout operators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative classical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators. We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil. A normal form of each individual member of the pencil depends on the discriminant of a certain quadratic polynomial. We also classify orderable quadratic rime associative algebras. For the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution, there is a choice of the multiparameters, for which it can be non-trivially rimed. However, not every Belavin-Drinfeld triple admits a choice of the multiparameters for which it can be rimed. We give a minimal example.

Quadratic centers defining elliptic surfaces - Let $X$ be a quadratic vector field with a center whose generic orbits are algebraic curves of genus one. To each $X$ we associate an elliptic surface (a smooth complex compact surface which is a genus one fibration). We give the list of all such vector fields and determine the corresponding elliptic surfaces.

Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group Method Applied to the Ising Model on the Hyperbolic Plane - Critical behavior of the Ising model is investigated at the center of large scale finite size systems, where the lattice is represented as the tiling of pentagons. The system is on the hyperbolic plane, and the recursive structure of the lattice makes it possible to apply the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. From the calculated nearest neighbor spin correlation function and the spontaneous magnetization, it is concluded that the phase transition of this model is mean-field like. One parameter deformation of the corner Hamiltonian on the hyperbolic plane is discussed.

Inferring periodic orbits from spectra of simple shaped micro-lasers - Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with micro-disks.

Zeta function and cryptographic exponent of supersingular curves of genus 2 - We compute in a direct (not algorithmic) way the zeta function of all supersingular curves of genus 2 over a finite field k, with many geometric automorphisms. We display these computations in an appendix where we select a family of representatives of all these curves up to geometric isomorphism and we exhibit equations and the zeta function of all their twists. As an application we obtain a direct computation of the cryptographic exponent of the Jacobians of these curves.

Dynamic Effects Increasing Network Vulnerability to Cascading Failures - We study cascading failures in networks using a dynamical flow model based on simple conservation and distribution laws to investigate the impact of transient dynamics caused by the rebalancing of loads after an initial network failure (triggering event). It is found that considering the flow dynamics may imply reduced network robustness compared to previous static overload failure models. This is due to the transient oscillations or overshooting in the loads, when the flow dynamics adjusts to the new (remaining) network structure. We obtain {\em upper} and {\em lower} limits to network robustness, and it is shown that {\it two} time scales $\tau$ and $\tau_0$, defined by the network dynamics, are important to consider prior to accurately addressing network robustness or vulnerability. The robustness of networks showing cascading failures is generally determined by a complex interplay between the network topology and flow dynamics, where the ratio $\chi=\tau/\tau_0$ determines the relative role of the two of them.

Ramsey fringes formation during excitation of topological modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate - The Ramsey fringes formation during the excitation of topological coherent modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate by an external modulating field is considered. The Ramsey fringes appear when a series of pulses of the excitation field is applied. In both Rabi and Ramsey interrogations, there is a shift of the population maximum transfer due to the strong non-linearity present in the system. It is found that the Ramsey pattern itself retains information about the accumulated relative phase between both ground and excited coherent modes.

The Allen-Cahn Action functional in higher dimensions - The Allen-Cahn action functional is related to the probability of rare events in the stochastically perturbed Allen-Cahn equation. Formal calculations suggest a reduced action functional in the sharp interface limit. We prove in two and three space dimensions the corresponding lower bound. One difficulty is that diffuse interfaces may collapse in the limit. We therefore consider the limit of diffuse surface area measures and introduce a generalized velocity and generalized reduced action functional in a class of evolving measures. As a corollary we obtain the Gamma convergence of the action functional in a class of regularly evolving hypersurfaces.

Metrical characterization of super-reflexivity and linear type of Banach spaces - We prove that a Banach space X is not super-reflexive if and only if the hyperbolic infinite tree embeds metrically into X. We improve one implication of J.Bourgain's result who gave a metrical characterization of super-reflexivity in Banach spaces in terms of uniforms embeddings of the finite trees. A characterization of the linear type for Banach spaces is given using the embedding of the infinite tree equipped with a suitable metric.

Search for exclusive events using the dijet mass fraction at the Tevatron - In this paper, we discuss the observation of exclusive events using the dijet mass fraction as measured by the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron. We compare the data to pomeron exchange inspired models as well as Soft color interaction ones. We also provide the prediction on dijet mass fraction at the LHC using both exclusive and inclusive diffractive events.

Entanglement Cost for Sequences of Arbitrary Quantum States - The entanglement cost of arbitrary sequences of bipartite states is shown to be expressible as the minimization of a conditional spectral entropy rate over sequences of separable extensions of the states in the sequence. The expression is shown to reduce to the regularized entanglement of formation when the n-th state in the sequence consists of n copies of a single bipartite state.

Line and continuum variability of two intermediate-redshift, high-luminosity quasars - It has been shown that the luminosity of AGNs and the size of their broad line region obey a simple relation of the type R=a L^g, from faint Seyfert nuclei to bright quasars, allowing single-epoch determination of the central black hole mass M=b L^g D^2 from their luminosity L and width of H_beta emission line. Adopting this mass determination for cosmological studies requires the extrapolation to high z and L of a relation whose calibration relies so far on reverberation mapping measurements performed for L<10^46 erg/s and z<0.4. We initiated a campaign for the monitoring of a few luminous, intermediate z quasars whose apparent magnitude V<15.7 allows observations with a 1.8m telescope, aimed at proving that emission lines vary and respond to continuum variations even for luminosities >10^47 erg/s, and determining eventually their M_BH from reverberation mapping. We have repeatedly performed simultaneous observations of quasars and reference stars to determine relative variability of continuum and emission lines. We describe the observations and methods of analysis. For the quasars PG1634+706 and PG1247+268 we obtain light-curves respectively for CIII], MgII and for CIV, CIII] emission lines with the relevant continua. During 3.2 years of observation, in the former case no continuum variability has been detected and the evidence for line variability is marginal, while in the latter case both continuum and line variability are detected with high significance and the line variations appear correlated with continuum variations. The detection of the emission line variability in a quasar with L~10^47 erg/s encourages the prosecution of the campaign which should provide a black hole mass estimate in other 5-6 years, constraining the M_BH-L relation in a poorly explored range of luminosity.

Adiabatic passage in a three-state system with non-Markovian relaxation: The role of excited-state absorption and two-exciton processes - The influence of excited-state absorption (ESA) and two-exciton processes on a coherent population transfer with intense ultrashort chirped pulses in molecular systems in solution has been studied. An unified treatment of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in such systems has been developed using a three-state electronic system with relaxation treated as a diffusion on electronic potential energy surfaces. We have shown that ESA has a profound effect on coherent population transfer in large molecules that necessitates a more accurate interpretation of experimental data. A simple and physically clear model for ARP in molecules with three electronic states in solution has been developed by extending the Landau-Zener calculations putting in a third level to random crossing of levels. A method for quantum control of two-exciton states in molecular complexes has been proposed.

Harmonic bilocal fields generated by globally conformal invariant scalar fields - The twist two contribution in the operator product expansion of phi_1(x_1) phi_2(x_2) for a pair of globally conformal invariant, scalar fields of equal scaling dimension d in four space-time dimensions is a field V_1(x_1,x_2) which is harmonic in both variables. It is demonstrated that the Huygens bilocality of V_1 can be equivalently characterized by a "single-pole property" concerning the pole structure of the (rational) correlation functions involving the product phi_1(x_1) phi_2(x_2). This property is established for the dimension d=2 of phi_1, phi_2. As an application we prove that any system of GCI scalar fields of conformal dimension 2 (in four space-time dimensions) can be presented as a (possibly infinite) superposition of products of free massless fields.

Impact of spin-zero particle-photon interactions on light polarization in external magnetic fields - If the recent PVLAS results on polarization changes of a linearly polarized laser beam passing through a magnetic field are interpreted by an axion-like particle, it is almost certain that it is not a standard QCD axion. Considering this, we study the general effective interactions of photons with spin-zero particles without restricting the latter to be a pseudo-scalar or a scalar, i.e., a parity eigenstate. At the lowest order in effective field theory, there are two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated separately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution in an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons, we compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for two experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While the first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the second applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way propagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of polarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does not change. For the round-trip propagation, however, the standard results of polarization changes for a pseudoscalar or a scalar are only modified by a factor that depends on the relative strength of the two interactions.

A simple test of quantumness for a single system - We propose a simple test of quantumness which can decide whether for the given set of accessible experimental data the classical model is insufficient. Take two observables $ A,B$ such that for any state $\psi$ their mean values satisfy $0\leq <\psi|A|\psi>\leq <\psi|B|\psi>\leq 1$. If there exists a state $\phi$ such that the second moments fulfill the inequality $<\phi|A^2|\phi> ><\phi|B^2|\phi>$ then the system cannot be described by the classical probabilistic scheme. An example of an optimal triple $(A,B,\phi)$ in the case of a qubit is given.

SPITZER: Accretion in Low Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Lambda Orionis Cluster - We present multi-wavelength optical and infrared photometry of 170 previously known low mass stars and brown dwarfs of the 5 Myr Collinder 69 cluster (Lambda Orionis). The new photometry supports cluster membership for most of them, with less than 15% of the previous candidates identified as probable non-members. The near infrared photometry allows us to identify stars with IR excesses, and we find that the Class II population is very large, around 25% for stars (in the spectral range M0 - M6.5) and 40% for brown dwarfs, down to 0.04 Msun, despite the fact that the H(alpha) equivalent width is low for a significant fraction of them. In addition, there are a number of substellar objects, classified as Class III, that have optically thin disks. The Class II members are distributed in an inhomogeneous way, lying preferentially in a filament running toward the south-east. The IR excesses for the Collinder 69 members range from pure Class II (flat or nearly flat spectra longward of 1 micron), to transition disks with no near-IR excess but excesses beginning within the IRAC wavelength range, to two stars with excess only detected at 24 micron. Collinder 69 thus appears to be at an age where it provides a natural laboratory for the study of primordial disks and their dissipation.

A data-analysis driven comparison of analytic and numerical coalescing binary waveforms: nonspinning case - We compare waveforms obtained by numerically evolving nonspinning binary black holes to post-Newtonian (PN) template families currently used in the search for gravitational waves by ground-based detectors. We find that the time-domain 3.5PN template family, which includes the inspiral phase, has fitting factors (FFs) >= 0.96 for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 20 Msun. The time-domain 3.5PN effective-one-body template family, which includes the inspiral, merger and ring-down phases, gives satisfactory signal-matching performance with FFs >= 0.96 for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 120 Msun. If we introduce a cutoff frequency properly adjusted to the final black-hole ring-down frequency, we find that the frequency-domain stationary-phase-approximated template family at 3.5PN order has FFs >= 0.96 for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 20 Msun. However, to obtain high matching performances for larger binary masses, we need to either extend this family to unphysical regions of the parameter space or introduce a 4PN order coefficient in the frequency-domain GW phase. Finally, we find that the phenomenological Buonanno-Chen-Vallisneri family has FFs >= 0.97 with total mass M=10 ~ 120Msun. The main analyses use the noise spectral-density of LIGO, but several tests are extended to VIRGO and advanced LIGO noise-spectral densities.

Quantum entanglement of decohered two-mode squeezed states in absorbing and amplifying environment - We investigate the properties of quantum entanglement of two-mode squeezed states interacting with linear baths with general gain and loss parameters. By explicitly solving for \rho from the master equation, we determine analytical expressions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \rho^{T_A} (the partial transposition of density matrix \rho). In Fock space, \rho^{T_A} is shown to maintain a block diagonal structure as the system evolves. In addition, we discover that the decoherence induced by the baths would break the degeneracy of \rho^{T_A}, and leads to a novel set of eigenvectors for the construction of entanglement witness operators. Such eigenvectors are shown to be time-independent, which is a signature of robust entanglement of two-mode squeezed states in the presence of noise.

Some new observations on interpolation in the spectral unit ball - We present several results associated to a holomorphic-interpolation problem for the spectral unit ball \Omega_n, n\geq 2. We begin by showing that a known necessary condition for the existence of a $\mathcal{O}(D;\Omega_n)$-interpolant (D here being the unit disc in the complex plane), given that the matricial data are non-derogatory, is not sufficient. We provide next a new necessary condition for the solvability of the two-point interpolation problem -- one which is not restricted only to non-derogatory data, and which incorporates the Jordan structure of the prescribed data. We then use some of the ideas used in deducing the latter result to prove a Schwarz-type lemma for holomorphic self-maps of \Omega_n, n\geq 2.

The microcanonical ensemble of the ideal relativistic quantum gas - We derive the microcanonical partition function of the ideal relativistic quantum gas of spinless bosons in a quantum field framework as an expansion over fixed multiplicities. Our calculation generalizes well known expressions in literature in that it does not introduce any large volume approximation and it is valid at any volume. We discuss the issues concerned with the definition of the microcanonical ensemble for a free quantum field at volumes comparable with the Compton wavelength and provide a consistent prescription of calculating the microcanonical partition function, which is finite at finite volume and yielding the correct thermodynamic limit. Besides an immaterial overall factor, the obtained expression turns out to be the same as in the non-relativistic multi-particle approach. This work is introductory to derive the most general expression of the microcanonical partition function fixing the maximal set of observables of the Poincare' group.

The spin-flip phenomenon in supermassive black hole binary mergers - Massive merging black holes will be the primary sources of powerful gravitational waves at low frequency, and will permit to test general relativity with candidate galaxies close to a binary black hole merger. In this paper we identify the typical mass ratio of the two black holes but then show that the distance when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative effect (over dynamical friction) does not depend on the mass ratio. However the dynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For the typical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This already occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically by post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a super-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively a powerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of a thick disk. These specific galaxies are thus candidates for a merger of two black holes to happen in the astronomically near future.

On the Young-Fibonacci insertion algorithm - This work is concerned with some properties of the Young-Fibonacci insertion algorithm and its relation with Fomin's growth diagrams. It also investigates a relation between the combinatorics of Young-Fibonacci tableaux and the study of Okada's algebra associated to the Young-Fibonacci lattice. The original algorithm was introduced by Roby and we redefine it in such a way that both the insertion and recording tableaux of any permutation are \emph{conveniently} interpreted as chains in the Young-Fibonacci lattice. A property of Killpatrick's evacuation is given a simpler proof, but this evacuation is no longer needed in making Roby's and Fomin's constructions coincide. We provide the set of Young-Fibonacci tableaux of size $n$ with a structure of graded poset, induced by the weak order on permutations of the symmetric group, and realized by transitive closure of elementary transformations on tableaux. We show that this poset gives a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients in the transition matrix from the analogue of complete symmetric functions to analogue of the Schur functions in Okada's algebra. We end with a quite similar observation for four posets on Young-tableaux studied by Taskin.

Thermoelectric response near a quantum critical point: the case of CeCoIn5 - We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K and up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum criticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the Nernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down to lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient to electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold of the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_c(H), in the vortex-liquid state, the Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other superconductors and standard vortex dynamics.

Dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices at non-zero temperatures - We consider the evolution and dissipation of vortex rings in a condensate at non-zero temperature, in the context of the classical field approximation, based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The temperature in such a system is fully determined by the total number density and the number density of the condensate. A vortex ring is introduced into a condensate in a state of thermal equilibrium, and interacts with non-condensed particles. These interactions lead to a gradual decrease in the vortex line density, until the vortex ring completely disappears. We show that the square of the vortex line length changes linearly with time, and obtain the corresponding universal decay law. We relate this to mutual friction coefficients in the fundamental equation of vortex motion in superfluids.

Critical edge behavior in unitary random matrix ensembles and the thirty fourth Painleve transcendent - We describe a new universality class for unitary invariant random matrix ensembles. It arises in the double scaling limit of ensembles of random $n \times n$ Hermitian matrices $Z_{n,N}^{-1} |\det M|^{2\alpha} e^{-N \Tr V(M)} dM$ with $\alpha > -1/2$, where the factor $|\det M|^{2\alpha}$ induces critical eigenvalue behavior near the origin. Under the assumption that the limiting mean eigenvalue density associated with $V$ is regular, and that the origin is a right endpoint of its support, we compute the limiting eigenvalue correlation kernel in the double scaling limit as $n, N \to \infty$ such that $n^{2/3}(n/N-1) = O(1)$. We use the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the Riemann-Hilbert problem for polynomials on the line orthogonal with respect to the weight $|x|^{2\alpha} e^{-NV(x)}$. Our main attention is on the construction of a local parametrix near the origin by means of the $\psi$-functions associated with a distinguished solution of the Painleve XXXIV equation. This solution is related to a particular solution of the Painleve II equation, which however is different from the usual Hastings-McLeod solution.

Vibrational effects on low-temperature properties of molecular conductors - We calculate characteristic correlation functions for the Anderson model with additional phonon-assisted coupling to the odd conduction channel. This model describes, for example, the behavior of a molecule embedded between two electrodes in linear transport experiments where the position of the molecule with respect to the leads affects the tunneling amplitudes. We use variational projection-operator method and numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The spin is Kondo screened either by even or odd conduction channel depending on the gate voltage and electron-phonon coupling. However, in all regimes the gate-voltage dependence of the zero temperature conductance is found to be qualitatively the same as in the model with no coupling to the vibrational mode.

Agile low phase noise radio-frequency sine wave generator applied to experiments on ultracold atoms - We report on the frequency performance of a low cost (~500$) radio-frequency sine wave generator, using direct digital synthesis (DDS) and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The output frequency of the device may be changed dynamically to any arbitrary value ranging from DC to 10 MHz without any phase slip. Sampling effects are substantially reduced by a high sample rate, up to 1 MHz, and by a large memory length, more than 2.10^5 samples. By using a low noise external oscillator to clock the DDS, we demonstrate a phase noise as low as that of the master clock, that is at the level of -113 dB.rad^2/Hz at 1 Hz from the carrier for an output frequency of 3.75 MHz. The device is successfully used to confine an ultracold atomic cloud of rubidium 87 in a RF-based trap, and there is no extra heating from the RF source.

Growth rates for geometric complexities and counting functions in polygonal billiards - We introduce a new method for estimating the growth of various quantities arising in dynamical systems. We apply our method to polygonal billiards on surfaces of constant curvature. For instance, we obtain power bounds of degree two plus epsilon in length for the number of billiard orbits between almost all pairs of points in a planar polygon.

Information-Based Asset Pricing - A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept of noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price processes. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors. With each such "X-factor" we associate a market information process, the values of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor; the other represents "noise". The noise term is modelled by an independent Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on dividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the price of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The information-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin of stochastic volatility.

The Jumping Phenomenon of Hodge Numbers - Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold, consider a small deformation $\phi: \mathcal{X} \to B$ of $X$, the dimension of the Dolbeault cohomology groups $H^q(X_t,\Omega_{X_t}^p)$ may vary under this defromation. This paper will study such phenomenons by studying the obstructions to deform a class in $H^q(X,\Omega_X^p)$ with the parameter $t$ and get the formula for the obstructions.

Strange dibaryon resonance in the anti-KNN--piYN system - Three-body resonances in the \bar{K}NN system have been studied within a framework of the \bar{K}NN-\pi YN coupled hannel Faddeev equation. By solving the three-body equation the energy dependence of the resonant \bar{K}N amplitude is fully taken into account. The S-matrix pole has been investigated from the eigenvalue of the kernel with the analytic continuation of the scattering amplitude on the unphysical Riemann sheet. The \barKN interaction is constructed from the leading order term of the chiral Lagrangian using relativistic kinematics. The \Lambda(1405) resonance is dynamically generated in this model, where the \bar{K}N interaction parameters are fitted to the data of scattering length. As a result we find a three-body resonance of the strange dibaryon system with binding energy, B~79 MeV, and width, \Gamma~74 MeV. The energy of the three-body resonance is found to be sensitive to the model of the I=0 \barKN interaction.

SU(2) and SU(4) Kondo effect in double quantum dots - We investigate serial double quantum dot systems with on-site and inter-site interaction by means of Sch\"onhammer-Gunnarsson projection-operator method. The ground state is established by the competition between extended Kondo phases and localized singlet phases in spi$ degrees of freedom. We present and discuss different phases, as discerned by characteristic correlation functions. We discuss also how different phases would be seen in linear transport measurements.

V-cycle optimal convergence for DCT-III matrices - The paper analyzes a two-grid and a multigrid method for matrices belonging to the DCT-III algebra and generated by a polynomial symbol. The aim is to prove that the convergence rate of the considered multigrid method (V-cycle) is constant independent of the size of the given matrix. Numerical examples from differential and integral equations are considered to illustrate the claimed convergence properties.

Improved Measurement of the Positive Muon Lifetime and Determination of the Fermi Constant - The mean life of the positive muon has been measured to a precision of 11 ppm using a low-energy, pulsed muon beam stopped in a ferromagnetic target, which was surrounded by a scintillator detector array. The result, tau_mu = 2.197013(24) us, is in excellent agreement with the previous world average. The new world average tau_mu = 2.197019(21) us determines the Fermi constant G_F = 1.166371(6) x 10^-5 GeV^-2 (5 ppm). Additionally, the precision measurement of the positive muon lifetime is needed to determine the nucleon pseudoscalar coupling g_P.

Some notes on analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact manifolds - We propose a definition for analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact manifolds. This is given by the derivative at zero of a well-chosen combination of zeta functions of a fourth-order modified Rumin Laplacian. The regular value at zero (before differentiation) of this well-chosen combination of zeta functions is shown to be a contact invariant. The variation of our analytic torsion is given as the integral of local terms, together with a global term coming from the null-space of the Laplacian.

Universal 2+1-Dimensional Plane Equations in General Relativity and Evolutions of Disk Nebula - The general relativity is the base for any exact evolutionary theory of large scale structures. We calculate the universal 2+1-dimensional plane equations of gravitational field in general relativity. Based on the equations, the evolutions of disk nebula are discussed. A system of nebula can form binary stars or single star for different conditions. While any simplified linear theory forms only a single star system. It is proved that the nonlinear interactions are very general, so the binary stars are also common.

Nuclear matter in the crust of neutron stars - The properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter are investigated considering the self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach with inclusion of pairing correlations. For a comparison we also consider a relativistic mean field approach. The inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz cells, which leads to a smooth transition to the limit of homogeneous nuclear matter. The possible existence of various structures in the so-called pasta phase is investigated within this self-consistent approach and a comparison is made to results obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Results for the proton abundances and the pairing properties are discussed for densities for which clustering phenomena are obtained.

Electromagnetic Higgs production - The cross section for central diffractive Higgs production is calculated, for the LHC range of energies. The graphs for the possible mechanisms for Higgs production, through pomeron fusion and photon fusions are calculated for all possibilities allowed by the standard model. The cross section for central diffractive Higgs production through pomeron fusion, must be multiplied by a factor for the survival probability, to isolate the Higgs signal and reduce the background. Due to the small value of the survival probability $\Lb 4 \times 10^{-3}\Rb $, the cross sections for central diffractive Higgs production, in the two cases for pomeron fusion and photon fusion, are competitive.

Characterization of Closed Vector Fields in Finsler Geometry - The $\pi$-exterior derivative ${\o}d$, which is the Finslerian generalization of the (usual) exterior derivative $d$ of Riemannian geometry, is defined. The notion of a ${\o}d$-closed vector field is introduced and investigated. Various characterizations of ${\o}d$-closed vector fields are established. Some results concerning ${\o}d$-closed vector fields in relation to certain special Finsler spaces are obtained.

Pure inductive limit state and Kolmogorov's property - Let $(\clb,\lambda_t,\psi)$ be a $C^*$-dynamical system where $(\lambda_t: t \in \IT_+)$ be a semigroup of injective endomorphism and $\psi$ be an $(\lambda_t)$ invariant state on the $C^*$ subalgebra $\clb$ and $\IT_+$ is either non-negative integers or real numbers. The central aim of this exposition is to find a useful criteria for the inductive limit state $\clb \raro^{\lambda_t} \clb$ canonically associated with $\psi$ to be pure. We achieve this by exploring the minimal weak forward and backward Markov processes associated with the Markov semigroup on the corner von-Neumann algebra of the support projection of the state $\psi$ to prove that Kolmogorov's property [Mo2] of the Markov semigroup is a sufficient condition for the inductive state to be pure. As an application of this criteria we find a sufficient condition for a translation invariant factor state on a one dimensional quantum spin chain to be pure. This criteria in a sense complements criteria obtained in [BJKW,Mo2] as we could go beyond lattice symmetric states.

Classical nucleation theory in ordering alloys precipitating with L12 structure - By means of low-temperature expansions (LTEs), the nucleation free energy and the precipitate interface free energy are expressed as functions of the solubility limit for alloys which lead to the precipitation of a stoichiometric L12 compound such as Al-Sc or Al-Zr alloys. Classical nucleation theory is then used to obtain a simple expression of the nucleation rate whose validity is demonstrated by a comparison with atomic simulations. LTEs also explain why simple mean-field approximation like the Bragg-Williams approximation fails to predict correct nucleation rates in such an ordering alloy.

Jones index of a quantum dynamical semigroup - In this paper we consider a semigroup of completely positive maps $\tau=(\tau_t,t \ge 0)$ with a faithful normal invariant state $\phi$ on a type-$II_1$ factor $\cla_0$ and propose an index theory. We :achieve this via a more general Kolmogorov's type of construction for stationary Markov processes which naturally associate a nested isomorphic von-Neumann algebras. In particular this construction generalizes well known Jones construction associated with a sub-factor of type-II$_1$ factor.

Vacuum Polarization by a Magnetic Flux Tube at Finite Temperature in the Cosmic String Spacetime - In this paper we analyse the effect produced by the temperature in the vacuum polarization associated with charged massless scalar field in the presence of magnetic flux tube in the cosmic string spacetime. Three different configurations of magnetic fields are taken into account: $(i)$ a homogeneous field inside the tube, $(ii)$ a field proportional to $1/r$ and $(iii)$ a cylindrical shell with $\delta$-function. In these three cases, the axis of the infinitely long tube of radius $R$ coincides with the cosmic string. Because the complexity of this analysis in the region inside the tube, we consider the thermal effect in the region outside. In order to develop this analysis, we construct the thermal Green function associated with this system for the three above mentioned situations considering points in the region outside the tube. We explicitly calculate in the high-temperature limit, the thermal average of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor.

Single pion electro-- and neutrinoproduction on heavy targets - We present a calculation of single pion electroproduction cross sections on heavy targets in the kinematic region of the Delta(1232) resonance. Final state interactions of the pions are taken into account using the pion multiple scattering model of Adler, Nussinov and Paschos (ANP model). For electroproduction and neutral current reactions we obtain results for carbon, oxygen, argon and iron targets and find a significant reduction of the W-spectra for pi^0 as compared to the free nucleon case. On the other hand, the charged pion spectra are only little affected by final state interactions. Measurements of such cross sections with the CLAS detector at JLAB could help to improve our understanding of pion rescattering effects and serve as important/valuable input for calculations of single pion neutrinoproduction on heavy targets relevant for current and future long baseline neutrino experiments. Two ratios, in Eq. (3.8) and (3.10), will test important properties of the model.

Yukawa's Pion, Low-Energy QCD and Nuclear Chiral Dynamics - A survey is given of the evolution from Yukawa's early work, via the understanding of the pion as a Nambu-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD, to modern developments in the theory of the nucleus based on the chiral effective field theory representing QCD in its low-energy limit.

Competition between local and nonlocal dissipation effects in two-dimensional quantum Josephson junction arrays - We discuss the local and nonlocal dissipation effects on the existence of the global phase coherence transitions in two dimensional Josephson-coupled junctions. The quantum phase transitions are also examined for various lattice geometries: square, triangular and honeycomb. The T=0 superconductor-insulator phase transition is analyzed as a function of several control parameters which include self-capacitance and junction capacitance and both local and nonlocal dissipation effects. We found the critical value of the nonlocal dissipation parameter \alpha_{1} depends on a geometry of the lattice. The critical value of the normal state conductance seems to be difficult to obtain experimentally if we take into consideration different damping mechanisms which are presented in real physical systems.

Substrate-induced bandgap in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride - We determine the electronic structure of a graphene sheet on top of a lattice-matched hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate using ab initio density functional calculations. The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions. Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based field effect transistors.

Coherent dynamics of domain formation in the Bose Ferromagnet - We present a theory to describe domain formation observed very recently in a quenched Rb-87 gas, a typical ferromagnetic spinor Bose system. An overlap factor is introduced to characterize the symmetry breaking of M_F=\pm 1 components for the F=1 ferromagnetic condensate. We demonstrate that the domain formation is a co-effect of the quantum coherence and the thermal relaxation. A thermally enhanced quantum-oscillation is observed during the dynamical process of the domain formation. And the spatial separation of domains leads to significant decay of the M_F=0 component fraction in an initial M_F=0 condensate.

A Wave-function for Stringy Universes - We define a wave-function for string theory cosmological backgrounds. We give a prescription for computing its norm following an earlier analysis within general relativity. Under Euclidean continuation, the cosmologies we discuss in this paper are described in terms of compact parafermionic worldsheet systems. To define the wave-function we provide a T-fold description of the parafermionic conformal field theory, and of the corresponding string cosmology. In specific examples, we compute the norm of the wave-function and comment on its behavior as a function of moduli.

Query on Negative Temperature, Internal Interactions and Decrease of Entropy - After negative temperature is restated, we find that it will derive necessarily decrease of entropy. Negative temperature is based on the Kelvin scale and the condition dU>0 and dS<0. Conversely, there is also negative temperature for dU<0 and dS>0. But, negative temperature is contradiction with usual meaning of temperature and with some basic concepts of physics and mathematics. It is a question in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We proposed a possibility of decrease of entropy due to fluctuation magnified and internal interactions in some isolated systems. From this we discuss some possible examples and theories.

Absence of the Fifth Force Problem in a Model with Spontaneously Broken Dilatation Symmetry - A scale invariant model containing dilaton $\phi$ and dust (as a model of matter) is studied where the shift symmetry $\phi\to\phi +const.$ is spontaneously broken at the classical level due to intrinsic features of the model. The dilaton to matter coupling "constant" $f$ appears to be dependent of the matter density. In normal conditions, i.e. when the matter energy density is many orders of magnitude larger than the dilaton contribution to the dark energy density, $f$ becomes less than the ratio of the "mass of the vacuum" in the volume occupied by the matter to the Planck mass. The model yields this kind of "Archimedes law" without any especial (intended for this) choice of the underlying action and without fine tuning of the parameters. The model not only explains why all attempts to discover a scalar force correction to Newtonian gravity were unsuccessful so far but also predicts that in the near future there is no chance to detect such corrections in the astronomical measurements as well as in the specially designed fifth force experiments on intermediate, short (like millimeter) and even ultrashort (a few nanometer) ranges. This prediction is alternative to predictions of other known models.

Dark matter caustics and the enhancement of self-annihilation flux - Cold dark matter haloes are populated by caustics, which are yet to be resolved in N-body simulations or observed in the Universe. Secondary infall model provides a paradigm for the study of caustics in "typical" haloes assuming that they have had no major mergers and have grown only by smooth accretion. This is a particular characteristic of the smallest dark matter haloes of about 10^{-5} Mo, which although "atypical" contain no substructures and could have survived until now with no major mergers. Thus using this model as the first guidline, we evaluate the neutralino self-annihilation flux for these haloes. Our results show that caustics could leave a distinct sawteeth signature on the differential and cumulative fluxes coming from the outer regions of these haloes. The total annihilation signal from the regions away from the centre can be boosted by about forty percents.

Search for a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson in ppbar collisions - We describe a search for the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of 105 GeV/c^2 to 145 GeV/c^2 in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 450 pb^{-1} collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron ppbar collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The Higgs boson is required to be produced in association with a Z boson, and the Z boson is required to decay to either electrons or muons with the Higgs boson decaying to a bbbar pair. The data are well described by the expected background, leading to 95% confidence level cross section upper limits sigma(\ppbar\to ZH)x B(H\to\bbbar) in the range of 3.1 pb to 4.4 pb.
